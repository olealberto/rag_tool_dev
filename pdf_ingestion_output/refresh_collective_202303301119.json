It is important that you communicate all relevant information\n necessary for a person unfamiliar with your organization to fully understand your project. Before starting your\n responses to the narrative section, review the Funding Criteria definitions on page 6 of the Project Support\n guidelines. \n We recommend that you prepare your answers offline in a word processing program and copy/paste your\n responses into the appropriate text box in the online application. Please note that your application can be\n saved at any point and you may return to the application to continue work. \n 5 / 16\n\n1. Describe your project. Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and\n when and where your project takes place. \n Refresh Collective will run a high-level digital-arts program for innercity teenagers & grow our workforce of digital\n media artists in our 2023 Fresh Force program. \n Planning efforts largely revolve around partner collaborations. We've developed this mastery-level job training\n program since summer 2021 building meaningful arts education and workforce development around the six-week\n summer jobs program supported by our community partner Youth Opportunities Unlimited. We engage local\n recording artists and industry professionals to line up guest speakers, & we rely on our community partnerships for\n performance & apprenticeship opportunities for Fresh Force participants. \n Activities: \n January 2023 - Interviewing & onboarding teen participants begins \n May-June 2023 - Worksite orientation for fifteen teenagers chosen for the Fresh Force Juneteenth Weekend 2023\n - Our first Fresh Force performance will showcase the music of veteran Fresh Force participants to inspire new\n recruits \n June 20 - July 28 - The Fresh Force works 25-30 hours a week on payroll during the summer employment period at\n the Fresh Lab Recording Studio. All major instruction & production is completed during this summer intensive.\n August-December - Fall programming provides ongoing performance opportunities and industry connections for\n ongoing education & apprenticeship opportunities. For high school graduates we also help facilitate teacher aide &\n professional development opportunities like a digital music marketing masterclass with iHeartRadio.\n If the Fresh Force is implemented successfully teens will achieve these learning objectives:\n 1. Mastery of music production including lyric writing, digital music composition, recording engineering, mixing and\n mastering \n 2. Working knowledge of digital photography, videography & graphic design \n 4. Adept job-readiness skills and an understanding of digital media career paths\n 5. High level interpersonal communication skills to work in a team toward creative ends.\n Public Benefit \n 6 / 16\n\n2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n The Refresh Collective community includes all young people of the city of Cleveland, especially teenagers that\n attend CMSD schools, youth from black and brown communities, and young people with no other access to arts\n education. The Fresh Force recruits teens from our in-school high school programs at CMSD schools and digital\n media afterschool programs. \n To prepare teens for the onboarding process we offer free \"My First Job Interview\" workshops before interviewing\n applicants to narrow our list of Fresh Force teens down to fifteen. We then support the fifteen families through the\n complicated process to acquire a Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU) summer job. YOU validates family income to\n meet federal TANIF funding regulations, so each participant in the Fresh Force is from a \"Needy Family\".\n Youth voice drives all creative programming at Refresh Collective programming. When the Fresh Force performs\n they are expressing authentic perspectives from and aspirations for their community.\n 7 / 16\n\n2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n The Fresh Force program is built around the Refresh Collective Core Values of Active Mentorship & Synergistic\n Service. \n Active mentorship involves meeting teenagers where they are at & engaging them with culturally relevant hip-hop\n curriculum to grab their attention. From there we help students prepare for the professional experience. Often times\n the Fresh Force is the youth's first job, so Refresh Collective works to support them & their families through the\n entire process. \n Synergistic Service means we build long term working relationships with schools, community centers & other\n community leaders to enhance our programming and strengthen the Cleveland community. Arts agencies,\n independent artists & other hip-hop industry stakeholders are invited in to share their unique experience with the\n Fresh Force participants. Our goal is to prepare these teenagers to be the future workforce, so building this digitalarts network has real economic development outcomes for the community.\n Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n Fresh Force in-take interviews are used to identify each teenager's strengths & goals for growth. Teens are\n assigned to small groups to work with throughout the summer. From June 20 - July 28 small groups produce\n original hip-hop music, music videos, album art & custom apparel working collaboratively to meet a challenging set\n of deadlines. The Fresh Force teens themselves craft the message, vision & execution of these projects.\n Refresh staff deliver stair-step instruction building each small group up for each next step in the production\n process. Industry guests visit for Q&A's with the teens offering career advice & networking opportunities. The\n summer culminates with a performance at a local jazz venue where the young artists take the stage to perform their\n brand new music for the world. \n Each participant is prepared to continue their own career pursuits & collaborations at the end of the Summer. HipHop and digital media projects spiral out even after the Fresh Force concludes.\n 8 / 16\n\nOrganizational Capacity \n 4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.\n DeeJay Doc, Executive Director, acts as creative director of the Fresh Force program. He has over three decades\n experience of music production & has led the Refresh Collective to engage over 10,000 Cleveland youth in arts\n education since 2011. \n Philip Hewitt, Funding Cultivator, coordinates community partnerships especially Youth Opportunities Unlimited\n summer youth employment. He has ten years experience in youth mentorship. \n Zachary Schwartz, Lead Educator, is an experienced hip-hop journalist & creative writing educator. He has been\n working with Cleveland youth for five years & leads most of our arts education programming.\n CJ Thompson AKA Bars & Poetry and Olympio Jefferson AKA Anti are Educators & recording artists who grew up\n through Refresh programs. Now as college students they return in the summer as educators to help instruct.\n Juan Evans AKA Dark Note, Peer Mentor, is a two-year Fresh Force participant & high school grad who is in\n training to join Refresh education staff. \n 9 / 16\n\n4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to\n accomplish within this project? \n Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and\n equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. \n Goal Our goal is to engage fifteen deserving Cleveland\n teenagers in the 2023 Fresh Force program to meet the\n specific Refresh Collective arts education learning\n outcomes: \n 1. Mastery of music production \n 2. Working knowledge of photo, video & graphic design\n 4. Adept job-readiness skills & career exposure\n 5. High level interpersonal communication skills\n How will you know you have accomplished or made Outcomes: \n -33% returning Fresh Force participants from the 2022\n progress towards your goal? \n cohort \n -66% new Fresh Force participants \n -100% Retention rate throughout the six-week summer\n employment period \n -Observable growth in digital media production skills &\n social emotional competencies in each participant\n measured by pre- & post-surveys. \n -3 original hip-hop tracks produced \n -3 corresponding music videos produced \n -3 corresponding sets of album art produced\n -3 sets of custom apparel produced \n -At least 3 live performances \n 10 / 16\n\n5. Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an\n outside panelist reviewing your application? \n Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone\n who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,\n historical context., etc. \n Refresh Collective was founded as the Fresh Camp, a hip-hop in action summer camp that our Founder, David\n \"DeeJay Doc\" Harrill started in his living room at his home in the Glenville Neighborhood of Cleveland.\n Refresh Collective has delivered in-school arts-enrichment to every freshman class of MC2 STEM Cleveland\n Metropolitan School District (CMSD) High School since 2011. Each class composes, writes & records their own\n original hip hop track. \n In 2019 Refresh Collective moved to its current space in the Detroit Shoreway neighborhood of Cleveland. This\n storefront & educational recording studio is known as the Fresh Lab. Complete with a computer lab & 3 recording\n booths, the Fresh Lab can work with up to 20 young people at one time. \n The Fresh Force allows us to build the culture of Refresh Collective by building up teen participants toward mastery\n of the digital arts. Our hope is that the Fresh Force participants will continue to work with us after graduation as\n instructors & guest artists. \n Our Fresh Force allows teens to work for part-time wages through YOU Summer Youth Employment Program. CAC\n funds will allow us to offer stipends to 1-3 deserving students who cannot make it through the YOU onboarding\n process. We are working to arrange internships & apprenticeships with local industry professionals for deserving\n Fresh Force participants each Fall. The Fresh Force is an exciting workforce development & career exposure\n opportunity for innercity Cleveland youth. \n Project Budget and Financials Form - PS 2023 \n Completed - Aug 4 2022 \n Project Budget and Financials Form - 2023 PS \n Complete the following project budget tables. \n 11 / 16\n\nIncome \n Please describe your sources of income and their amounts in the table below.

How will you proceed with your project if your project doesn\u2019t receive the full amount of funding requested\n from CAC? \n Tip: Most applicants to Project Support receive a portion of the funds they request based on their score. CAC does\n not expect any organization to carry out their full project on only a partial budget.\n Refresh Collective solicit donations from our donor base year round. We regularly build relationships with local\n foundation & we would hope to be able to raise the $20,000 else where. \n Without full funding we would need to reduce our instructional staff and the fall season professional development\n and apprenticeship opportunities for the Fresh Force youth. \n Lastly we may need to reduce the Fresh Force numbers down from 15 if we are unable to fundraise for the full\n budget. \n Upload your SMU| DataArts Funder Report - PS \n 14 / 16\n\nCompleted - Aug 4 2022 \n For organizations whose maximum grant amount is $5,000 this section is optional.\n Required for organizations requesting more than $5,000.

Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and\n when and where your project takes place. \n Refresh Collective will run a high-level digital-arts program for innercity teenagers & grow our workforce of digital\n media artists in our 2023 Fresh Force program. \n Planning efforts largely revolve around partner collaborations. We've developed this mastery-level job training\n program since summer 2021 building meaningful arts education and workforce development around the six-week\n summer jobs program supported by our community partner Youth Opportunities Unlimited. We engage local\n recording artists and industry professionals to line up guest speakers, & we rely on our community partnerships for\n performance & apprenticeship opportunities for Fresh Force participants. \n Activities: \n January 2023 - Interviewing & onboarding teen participants begins \n May-June 2023 - Worksite orientation for fifteen teenagers chosen for the Fresh Force Juneteenth Weekend 2023\n - Our first Fresh Force performance will showcase the music of veteran Fresh Force participants to inspire new\n recruits \n June 20 - July 28 - The Fresh Force works 25-30 hours a week on payroll during the summer employment period at\n the Fresh Lab Recording Studio.

Working knowledge of digital photography, videography & graphic design \n 4. Adept job-readiness skills and an understanding of digital media career paths\n 5. High level interpersonal communication skills to work in a team toward creative ends.\n Public Benefit \n 6 / 16\n\n2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n The Refresh Collective community includes all young people of the city of Cleveland, especially teenagers that\n attend CMSD schools, youth from black and brown communities, and young people with no other access to arts\n education. The Fresh Force recruits teens from our in-school high school programs at CMSD schools and digital\n media afterschool programs. \n To prepare teens for the onboarding process we offer free \"My First Job Interview\" workshops before interviewing\n applicants to narrow our list of Fresh Force teens down to fifteen. We then support the fifteen families through the\n complicated process to acquire a Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU) summer job. YOU validates family income to\n meet federal TANIF funding regulations, so each participant in the Fresh Force is from a \"Needy Family\".\n Youth voice drives all creative programming at Refresh Collective programming. When the Fresh Force performs\n they are expressing authentic perspectives from and aspirations for their community.\n 7 / 16\n\n2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n The Fresh Force program is built around the Refresh Collective Core Values of Active Mentorship & Synergistic\n Service. \n Active mentorship involves meeting teenagers where they are at & engaging them with culturally relevant hip-hop\n curriculum to grab their attention. From there we help students prepare for the professional experience. Often times\n the Fresh Force is the youth's first job, so Refresh Collective works to support them & their families through the\n entire process. \n Synergistic Service means we build long term working relationships with schools, community centers & other\n community leaders to enhance our programming and strengthen the Cleveland community. Arts agencies,\n independent artists & other hip-hop industry stakeholders are invited in to share their unique experience with the\n Fresh Force participants. Our goal is to prepare these teenagers to be the future workforce, so building this digitalarts network has real economic development outcomes for the community.\n Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n Fresh Force in-take interviews are used to identify each teenager's strengths & goals for growth. Teens are\n assigned to small groups to work with throughout the summer. From June 20 - July 28 small groups produce\n original hip-hop music, music videos, album art & custom apparel working collaboratively to meet a challenging set\n of deadlines. The Fresh Force teens themselves craft the message, vision & execution of these projects.\n Refresh staff deliver stair-step instruction building each small group up for each next step in the production\n process. Industry guests visit for Q&A's with the teens offering career advice & networking opportunities. The\n summer culminates with a performance at a local jazz venue where the young artists take the stage to perform their\n brand new music for the world. \n Each participant is prepared to continue their own career pursuits & collaborations at the end of the Summer. HipHop and digital media projects spiral out even after the Fresh Force concludes.\n 8 / 16\n\nOrganizational Capacity \n 4a. Describe your team.

We regularly build relationships with local\n foundation & we would hope to be able to raise the $20,000 else where. \n Without full funding we would need to reduce our instructional staff and the fall season professional development\n and apprenticeship opportunities for the Fresh Force youth. \n Lastly we may need to reduce the Fresh Force numbers down from 15 if we are unable to fundraise for the full\n budget. \n Upload your SMU| DataArts Funder Report - PS \n 14 / 16\n\nCompleted - Aug 4 2022 \n For organizations whose maximum grant amount is $5,000 this section is optional.\n Required for organizations requesting more than $5,000.
