Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and\n when and where your project takes place. \n For over 46 years, the Baldwin Wallace Community Arts School (CAS) has been a center for summer arts\n programming. We are excited to continue the successful summer programming for all of our students. Overnight\n offerings for students in grades 4-9 include: String, Piano, Choral, Band, and Music Theatre Camp, and Dance\n Immersion. Each program includes a full day schedule: group rehearsals, sectionals, classes, social, and\n recreational activities. Exemplary local, regional, and national educators and teaching artists play a crucial role in\n leading the curriculum. Day classes for students in grades 4-9 include dance offerings in multiple styles, Dalcroze\n Eurhythmics, Printmaking, and Contemporary & Modern Art. For high school students (grades 9-12), we offer the\n Conservatory Summer Institute (CSI), a comprehensive program designed for musicians considering careers in the\n arts. CSI curriculum includes private lessons, chamber and full ensembles, and classes. Students may add tracks\n such as composition, Music Theatre (MT), or an Audition Preparation Program. Composition students have the\n opportunity to write an original piece for performance, and MT students perform a final showcase. CSI faculty\n includes BW Conservatory Faculty and members of The Cleveland Orchestra. Planning for these offerings begins\n immediately following the completion of our summer. Student, parent, and staff feedback is collected through\n anonymous surveys and is our first priority as we make changes for our upcoming year. We also receive invaluable\n feedback from local educators who sent their students to camp. Once these changes are recorded and planned,\n we turn to choosing our camp faculty from a list of esteemed local educators. There are university meetings to\n leverage all facilities and departments to the best of our ability. Additionally, Conservatory staff make regular visits\n to local schools to lead ensemble workshops, endeavoring to engage and recruit young artists for our summer\n programs. \n 5 / 14\n\nPublic Benefit \n 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n The Community Arts School (CAS) community includes any person seeking to engage in the arts. Throughout the\n summer, we engage over 500 students in our summer arts programs, hire over 100 artists, and provide free, public\n concerts to an audience of approximately 1500 community members. Students have access to state-of-the-art\n facilities and technology throughout their time here at CAS. Additionally, 30 pre-service music educators from BW\n and other universities are hired and provide hands-on learning experience as camp counselors. We engage with\n our community at large through school visits, anonymous surveys, and free concerts, masterclasses, and recitals\n throughout the academic year and the summer. School visits help us identify and recruit students who need tuition\n assistance to attend camp. We have listened to concerns and provide residential and commuter options for our\n camps and transportation for our students who receive scholarships to increase accessibility.\n 2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n CAS finds it integral to work with area partners to build and strengthen engagement and accessibility. We nurture\n relationships with funders for tuition assistance and work directly with social service agencies who seek\n opportunities for disadvantaged youth within the community. CAS works to ensure all students feel celebrated and\n reflected in leadership. Camp faculty this year included a diverse range - 33% identified as African-American or\n Black, and at least 25% identified within the LGBTQ+ community. Several counselors shared their non-binary\n identification with students, and all students were provided the opportunity to share their pronouns and identities\n with our staff, if desired. Our registration process includes areas to discuss accommodation necessities and\n designate a student\u2019s comfortability with transgender or non-binary roommates, ensuring the safety of our gender\n diverse students. These efforts, and our dedication to growth, help us maintain strong community relations.\n Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 6 / 14\n\n3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n Our organization is grateful to be located within Cuyahoga County, where active artists are plentiful and impressive.\n We work to ensure collaboration and learning between our camp participants and local artists each year for new,\n enriching experiences. For example, our middle school conductors bring music from new and underrepresented\n composers and unfamiliar styles to our String and Band campers. A BW Music Theatre graduate and performer\n joined our Music Theatre campers for a masterclass, performance, and Q&A session. She was able to share with\n our students the joys and challenges of her work, nurture their creativity and individuality, and advise those who\n are seeking careers in the arts. Additionally, our dancers in Dance Immersion were exposed to esteemed dance\n educators from the area. These educators brought new styles of dance to the students, including Latin ballroom\n and hip-hop. Dancers left our campus feeling inspired to engage with the arts in areas outside of their norm.\n Organizational Capacity \n 4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.\n Our team is made up of Community Arts School staff, Conservatory faculty, and educators throughout Ohio. Our\n administrative CAS team includes Adam Sheldon, Assistant Provost; Cory Isler-Manzo, Associate Director; Julia\n Morreale, Camp Manager; Heather Dennen, Director of Dance; Those listed transition into a management role\n while students are on campus with us. \n Baldwin Wallace faculty serving as Summer Arts Programs directors include Dr. David Pope, Chair of Music\n Education; Dr. Andrew Machamer, Professor of Music Education; and Dr. Julian Ross, Chair of the String\n Department and Professor of Violin. \n Conductors and sectional coaches are comprised of esteemed middle and high school music educators throughout\n Ohio. \n Please note, it takes many more people to successfully execute our project. We typically find ourselves with a team\n of approximately 100 staff and faculty members throughout the summer, including student counselors, CAS staff,\n and administrative personnel. \n 7 / 14\n\n4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to\n accomplish within this project? \n Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and\n equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. \n Goal Increase our reach to involve 5% more students from\n underrepresented and underfunded communities in our\n Middle School Camps. We know that 23% of our\n students were non-white. While we do not yet have as\n defined a process for collecting gender identity and\n sexual orientation information, we know from the\n students who chose to share their identities that at least\n 5% of our middle school students identified as trans or\n non-binary, and there are more students within the\n LGBTQ+ community as a whole. \n How will you know you have accomplished or made We will know we have made progress toward our goal\n by collecting data from our middle school students\n progress towards your goal? \n during summer 2023. Data will always be collected\n anonymously, but we hope that our students are willing\n to share their identities with us. We will also know we\n have made progress toward our goal by receiving\n feedback from families and students about their level of\n comfort and safety while under our care at camp. This\n feedback may come personally or through an\n anonymous survey. \n 8 / 14\n\n5. Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an\n outside panelist reviewing your application? \n Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone\n who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,\n historical context., etc. \n Our area partners are truly the key to bringing this exceptional programming to students in the community. We are\n always grateful for the support that CAC is able to provide to help us share the arts with our youth over the\n summer. Although we paused our field trips to mitigate COVID-19 spread, we are hopeful and excited to bring our\n students back into the community for Cleveland Orchestra concerts, Playhouse Square performances, and more in\n 2023. As part of a new equity initiative, an anonymous survey was provided to camp families asking for school\n district and racial identity information. Through this survey, we learned that our students come from 57 districts, and\n 23% of students identify as non-white. According to the Ohio census, this reflects a higher rate of racial diversity\n than the state of Ohio. Equipped with this information, we can set tangible goals to increase our reach in\n underrepresented communities. Additionally, we are working on gradual pay increases, especially for our student\n counselors, to raise weekly pay by $150 within 2 years. We added new support systems and policies to protect our\n LGBTQ+ students and our students of color, such as methods for reporting discrimination and ensuring safe\n roommates. In our 2022 survey, a parent told us about their student: \u201cthey liked being called their preferred name.\n They felt respected and safe.\u201d Although we are not done improving, we are glad to know that the students we are\n reaching feel comfortable with us. \n Project Budget and Financials Form - PS 2023 \n Completed - Aug 1 2022 \n Project Budget and Financials Form - 2023 PS \n Complete the following project budget tables. \n 9 / 14\n\nIncome \n Please describe your sources of income and their amounts in the table below.

How will you spend CAC funds? \n Tip: Indicate how CAC funds will be used. See list of prohibited uses of CAC funds on page #12 of the guidelines\n CAC funds support critical areas including: administrative personnel, artistic personnel, and production/event\n expenses. Of these areas, the majority of this funding will assist in hiring our artistic personnel (employees and\n contractors) who serve on the Summer Arts Program staff. As noted, this includes over 100 Cuyahoga County\n artists. These professionals are a key driver in delivering exception experiences to program participants.\n 11 / 14\n\n2. How will you proceed with your project if your project doesn\u2019t receive the full amount of funding requested\n from CAC? \n Tip: Most applicants to Project Support receive a portion of the funds they request based on their score. CAC does\n not expect any organization to carry out their full project on only a partial budget.\n If we do not receive the full amount of funding requested, we will need to limit the enrollment of our programs. As\n we are dedicated to ensuring one-on-one instruction, a smaller amount of funds available for exceptional\n professionals would have to result in a smaller amount of student numbers. In addition, we will be unable to fund\n our 2023 field trips to vibrant displays of art in the community, such as Cleveland Orchestra concerts and\n Playhouse Square performances. \n Upload your SMU| DataArts Funder Report - PS \n Completed - Aug 1 2022 \n For organizations whose maximum grant amount is $5,000 this section is optional.\n Required for organizations requesting more than $5,000.

For high school students (grades 9-12), we offer the\n Conservatory Summer Institute (CSI), a comprehensive program designed for musicians considering careers in the\n arts. CSI curriculum includes private lessons, chamber and full ensembles, and classes. Students may add tracks\n such as composition, Music Theatre (MT), or an Audition Preparation Program. Composition students have the\n opportunity to write an original piece for performance, and MT students perform a final showcase. CSI faculty\n includes BW Conservatory Faculty and members of The Cleveland Orchestra. Planning for these offerings begins\n immediately following the completion of our summer. Student, parent, and staff feedback is collected through\n anonymous surveys and is our first priority as we make changes for our upcoming year. We also receive invaluable\n feedback from local educators who sent their students to camp. Once these changes are recorded and planned,\n we turn to choosing our camp faculty from a list of esteemed local educators. There are university meetings to\n leverage all facilities and departments to the best of our ability. Additionally, Conservatory staff make regular visits\n to local schools to lead ensemble workshops, endeavoring to engage and recruit young artists for our summer\n programs. \n 5 / 14\n\nPublic Benefit \n 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n The Community Arts School (CAS) community includes any person seeking to engage in the arts. Throughout the\n summer, we engage over 500 students in our summer arts programs, hire over 100 artists, and provide free, public\n concerts to an audience of approximately 1500 community members. Students have access to state-of-the-art\n facilities and technology throughout their time here at CAS. Additionally, 30 pre-service music educators from BW\n and other universities are hired and provide hands-on learning experience as camp counselors. We engage with\n our community at large through school visits, anonymous surveys, and free concerts, masterclasses, and recitals\n throughout the academic year and the summer. School visits help us identify and recruit students who need tuition\n assistance to attend camp. We have listened to concerns and provide residential and commuter options for our\n camps and transportation for our students who receive scholarships to increase accessibility.\n 2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n CAS finds it integral to work with area partners to build and strengthen engagement and accessibility. We nurture\n relationships with funders for tuition assistance and work directly with social service agencies who seek\n opportunities for disadvantaged youth within the community. CAS works to ensure all students feel celebrated and\n reflected in leadership. Camp faculty this year included a diverse range - 33% identified as African-American or\n Black, and at least 25% identified within the LGBTQ+ community. Several counselors shared their non-binary\n identification with students, and all students were provided the opportunity to share their pronouns and identities\n with our staff, if desired. Our registration process includes areas to discuss accommodation necessities and\n designate a student\u2019s comfortability with transgender or non-binary roommates, ensuring the safety of our gender\n diverse students. These efforts, and our dedication to growth, help us maintain strong community relations.\n Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 6 / 14\n\n3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n Our organization is grateful to be located within Cuyahoga County, where active artists are plentiful and impressive.\n We work to ensure collaboration and learning between our camp participants and local artists each year for new,\n enriching experiences. For example, our middle school conductors bring music from new and underrepresented\n composers and unfamiliar styles to our String and Band campers. A BW Music Theatre graduate and performer\n joined our Music Theatre campers for a masterclass, performance, and Q&A session. She was able to share with\n our students the joys and challenges of her work, nurture their creativity and individuality, and advise those who\n are seeking careers in the arts. Additionally, our dancers in Dance Immersion were exposed to esteemed dance\n educators from the area. These educators brought new styles of dance to the students, including Latin ballroom\n and hip-hop. Dancers left our campus feeling inspired to engage with the arts in areas outside of their norm.\n Organizational Capacity \n 4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.\n Our team is made up of Community Arts School staff, Conservatory faculty, and educators throughout Ohio. Our\n administrative CAS team includes Adam Sheldon, Assistant Provost; Cory Isler-Manzo, Associate Director; Julia\n Morreale, Camp Manager; Heather Dennen, Director of Dance; Those listed transition into a management role\n while students are on campus with us. \n Baldwin Wallace faculty serving as Summer Arts Programs directors include Dr. David Pope, Chair of Music\n Education; Dr. Andrew Machamer, Professor of Music Education; and Dr. Julian Ross, Chair of the String\n Department and Professor of Violin. \n Conductors and sectional coaches are comprised of esteemed middle and high school music educators throughout\n Ohio. \n Please note, it takes many more people to successfully execute our project. We typically find ourselves with a team\n of approximately 100 staff and faculty members throughout the summer, including student counselors, CAS staff,\n and administrative personnel. \n 7 / 14\n\n4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to\n accomplish within this project? \n Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and\n equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. \n Goal Increase our reach to involve 5% more students from\n underrepresented and underfunded communities in our\n Middle School Camps. We know that 23% of our\n students were non-white. While we do not yet have as\n defined a process for collecting gender identity and\n sexual orientation information, we know from the\n students who chose to share their identities that at least\n 5% of our middle school students identified as trans or\n non-binary, and there are more students within the\n LGBTQ+ community as a whole. \n How will you know you have accomplished or made We will know we have made progress toward our goal\n by collecting data from our middle school students\n progress towards your goal? \n during summer 2023. Data will always be collected\n anonymously, but we hope that our students are willing\n to share their identities with us. We will also know we\n have made progress toward our goal by receiving\n feedback from families and students about their level of\n comfort and safety while under our care at camp. This\n feedback may come personally or through an\n anonymous survey. \n 8 / 14\n\n5. Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an\n outside panelist reviewing your application? \n Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone\n who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,\n historical context., etc. \n Our area partners are truly the key to bringing this exceptional programming to students in the community. We are\n always grateful for the support that CAC is able to provide to help us share the arts with our youth over the\n summer. Although we paused our field trips to mitigate COVID-19 spread, we are hopeful and excited to bring our\n students back into the community for Cleveland Orchestra concerts, Playhouse Square performances, and more in\n 2023. As part of a new equity initiative, an anonymous survey was provided to camp families asking for school\n district and racial identity information. Through this survey, we learned that our students come from 57 districts, and\n 23% of students identify as non-white. According to the Ohio census, this reflects a higher rate of racial diversity\n than the state of Ohio. Equipped with this information, we can set tangible goals to increase our reach in\n underrepresented communities. Additionally, we are working on gradual pay increases, especially for our student\n counselors, to raise weekly pay by $150 within 2 years. We added new support systems and policies to protect our\n LGBTQ+ students and our students of color, such as methods for reporting discrimination and ensuring safe\n roommates. In our 2022 survey, a parent told us about their student: \u201cthey liked being called their preferred name.\n They felt respected and safe.\u201d Although we are not done improving, we are glad to know that the students we are\n reaching feel comfortable with us. \n Project Budget and Financials Form - PS 2023 \n Completed - Aug 1 2022 \n Project Budget and Financials Form - 2023 PS \n Complete the following project budget tables. \n 9 / 14\n\nIncome \n Please describe your sources of income and their amounts in the table below.

How will you spend CAC funds? \n Tip: Indicate how CAC funds will be used. See list of prohibited uses of CAC funds on page #12 of the guidelines\n CAC funds support critical areas including: administrative personnel, artistic personnel, and production/event\n expenses. Of these areas, the majority of this funding will assist in hiring our artistic personnel (employees and\n contractors) who serve on the Summer Arts Program staff. As noted, this includes over 100 Cuyahoga County\n artists. These professionals are a key driver in delivering exception experiences to program participants.\n 11 / 14\n\n2. How will you proceed with your project if your project doesn\u2019t receive the full amount of funding requested\n from CAC? \n Tip: Most applicants to Project Support receive a portion of the funds they request based on their score. CAC does\n not expect any organization to carry out their full project on only a partial budget.\n If we do not receive the full amount of funding requested, we will need to limit the enrollment of our programs. As\n we are dedicated to ensuring one-on-one instruction, a smaller amount of funds available for exceptional\n professionals would have to result in a smaller amount of student numbers. In addition, we will be unable to fund\n our 2023 field trips to vibrant displays of art in the community, such as Cleveland Orchestra concerts and\n Playhouse Square performances. \n Upload your SMU| DataArts Funder Report - PS \n Completed - Aug 1 2022 \n For organizations whose maximum grant amount is $5,000 this section is optional.\n Required for organizations requesting more than $5,000.

The University fulfills this mission through excellence in teaching and learning within a\n challenging, supportive environment that enhances students' intellectual and spiritual growth. BW Community Arts\n School Mission: To enrich lives by providing experiences that promote life-long engagement with the arts.\n Organizational history \n The Baldwin Wallace University Conservatory of Music, founded in 1899 by organist and Bach scholar Albert\n Riemenschneider, offers a long tradition of musical excellence to our campus and the larger community. Today,\n more than 300 undergraduate students study at the Conservatory under the tutelage of faculty members of The\n Cleveland Orchestra, respected conductors, theorists, historians, and educators. As a part of a key strategy in\n supporting our greater community, the Conservatory Outreach Department was founded in 1976 as a divisional\n school of the University. Founded as a community music school, its main focus was to offer Dalcroze classes and\n music lessons for younger children. Through compelling market research and as a strategic priority to the university,\n the division was expanded in 2019 to become the Community Arts School. The program portfolio was expanded to\n include dance, music, theater, and visual art classes for students of any age and ability.\n Grant Contact Information \n Grant Contact Name Julia Morreale \n Title Coordinator, Camps and School Partnerships\n Email Address \n Phone \n Financial Snapshot \n Enter your organization\u2019s total budget (expenses) for the 2022 fiscal year. \n $ 7,295,945 \n Project Basics Form - PS 2023 \n 2 / 14\n\nCompleted - Aug 1 2022 \n Project Basics Form - 2023 PS \n Project Basics \n Use the fields in this section to provide basic project details. \n 1.

They are not funded by BW. Tuition supports daily meals,\n housing, staff and faculty, and all activities. Each offering ends with a concert or presentation that is free and open\n to the public. CAC support allows for the capacity to carry out programming while keeping participant fees\n affordable for all students. We partner with area foundations to provide scholarships to students who may not have\n the financial capacity to afford the full tuition. \n Application Narrative Form - PS 2023 \n Completed - Aug 1 2022 \n Application Narrative Form - PS \n 4 / 14\n\nThe narrative is an important part of your application.

Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and\n when and where your project takes place. \n For over 46 years, the Baldwin Wallace Community Arts School (CAS) has been a center for summer arts\n programming. We are excited to continue the successful summer programming for all of our students. Overnight\n offerings for students in grades 4-9 include: String, Piano, Choral, Band, and Music Theatre Camp, and Dance\n Immersion. Each program includes a full day schedule: group rehearsals, sectionals, classes, social, and\n recreational activities. Exemplary local, regional, and national educators and teaching artists play a crucial role in\n leading the curriculum. Day classes for students in grades 4-9 include dance offerings in multiple styles, Dalcroze\n Eurhythmics, Printmaking, and Contemporary & Modern Art. For high school students (grades 9-12), we offer the\n Conservatory Summer Institute (CSI), a comprehensive program designed for musicians considering careers in the\n arts. CSI curriculum includes private lessons, chamber and full ensembles, and classes. Students may add tracks\n such as composition, Music Theatre (MT), or an Audition Preparation Program. Composition students have the\n opportunity to write an original piece for performance, and MT students perform a final showcase. CSI faculty\n includes BW Conservatory Faculty and members of The Cleveland Orchestra. Planning for these offerings begins\n immediately following the completion of our summer. Student, parent, and staff feedback is collected through\n anonymous surveys and is our first priority as we make changes for our upcoming year. We also receive invaluable\n feedback from local educators who sent their students to camp. Once these changes are recorded and planned,\n we turn to choosing our camp faculty from a list of esteemed local educators. There are university meetings to\n leverage all facilities and departments to the best of our ability. Additionally, Conservatory staff make regular visits\n to local schools to lead ensemble workshops, endeavoring to engage and recruit young artists for our summer\n programs. \n 5 / 14\n\nPublic Benefit \n 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n The Community Arts School (CAS) community includes any person seeking to engage in the arts. Throughout the\n summer, we engage over 500 students in our summer arts programs, hire over 100 artists, and provide free, public\n concerts to an audience of approximately 1500 community members. Students have access to state-of-the-art\n facilities and technology throughout their time here at CAS. Additionally, 30 pre-service music educators from BW\n and other universities are hired and provide hands-on learning experience as camp counselors. We engage with\n our community at large through school visits, anonymous surveys, and free concerts, masterclasses, and recitals\n throughout the academic year and the summer. School visits help us identify and recruit students who need tuition\n assistance to attend camp. We have listened to concerns and provide residential and commuter options for our\n camps and transportation for our students who receive scholarships to increase accessibility.\n 2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n CAS finds it integral to work with area partners to build and strengthen engagement and accessibility. We nurture\n relationships with funders for tuition assistance and work directly with social service agencies who seek\n opportunities for disadvantaged youth within the community. CAS works to ensure all students feel celebrated and\n reflected in leadership. Camp faculty this year included a diverse range - 33% identified as African-American or\n Black, and at least 25% identified within the LGBTQ+ community. Several counselors shared their non-binary\n identification with students, and all students were provided the opportunity to share their pronouns and identities\n with our staff, if desired. Our registration process includes areas to discuss accommodation necessities and\n designate a student\u2019s comfortability with transgender or non-binary roommates, ensuring the safety of our gender\n diverse students. These efforts, and our dedication to growth, help us maintain strong community relations.\n Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 6 / 14\n\n3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n Our organization is grateful to be located within Cuyahoga County, where active artists are plentiful and impressive.\n We work to ensure collaboration and learning between our camp participants and local artists each year for new,\n enriching experiences. For example, our middle school conductors bring music from new and underrepresented\n composers and unfamiliar styles to our String and Band campers. A BW Music Theatre graduate and performer\n joined our Music Theatre campers for a masterclass, performance, and Q&A session. She was able to share with\n our students the joys and challenges of her work, nurture their creativity and individuality, and advise those who\n are seeking careers in the arts. Additionally, our dancers in Dance Immersion were exposed to esteemed dance\n educators from the area. These educators brought new styles of dance to the students, including Latin ballroom\n and hip-hop. Dancers left our campus feeling inspired to engage with the arts in areas outside of their norm.\n Organizational Capacity \n 4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.\n Our team is made up of Community Arts School staff, Conservatory faculty, and educators throughout Ohio. Our\n administrative CAS team includes Adam Sheldon, Assistant Provost; Cory Isler-Manzo, Associate Director; Julia\n Morreale, Camp Manager; Heather Dennen, Director of Dance; Those listed transition into a management role\n while students are on campus with us. \n Baldwin Wallace faculty serving as Summer Arts Programs directors include Dr. David Pope, Chair of Music\n Education; Dr. Andrew Machamer, Professor of Music Education; and Dr. Julian Ross, Chair of the String\n Department and Professor of Violin. \n Conductors and sectional coaches are comprised of esteemed middle and high school music educators throughout\n Ohio. \n Please note, it takes many more people to successfully execute our project. We typically find ourselves with a team\n of approximately 100 staff and faculty members throughout the summer, including student counselors, CAS staff,\n and administrative personnel. \n 7 / 14\n\n4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to\n accomplish within this project? \n Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and\n equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. \n Goal Increase our reach to involve 5% more students from\n underrepresented and underfunded communities in our\n Middle School Camps. We know that 23% of our\n students were non-white. While we do not yet have as\n defined a process for collecting gender identity and\n sexual orientation information, we know from the\n students who chose to share their identities that at least\n 5% of our middle school students identified as trans or\n non-binary, and there are more students within the\n LGBTQ+ community as a whole. \n How will you know you have accomplished or made We will know we have made progress toward our goal\n by collecting data from our middle school students\n progress towards your goal? \n during summer 2023. Data will always be collected\n anonymously, but we hope that our students are willing\n to share their identities with us. We will also know we\n have made progress toward our goal by receiving\n feedback from families and students about their level of\n comfort and safety while under our care at camp. This\n feedback may come personally or through an\n anonymous survey. \n 8 / 14\n\n5. Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an\n outside panelist reviewing your application? \n Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone\n who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,\n historical context., etc. \n Our area partners are truly the key to bringing this exceptional programming to students in the community. We are\n always grateful for the support that CAC is able to provide to help us share the arts with our youth over the\n summer. Although we paused our field trips to mitigate COVID-19 spread, we are hopeful and excited to bring our\n students back into the community for Cleveland Orchestra concerts, Playhouse Square performances, and more in\n 2023. As part of a new equity initiative, an anonymous survey was provided to camp families asking for school\n district and racial identity information. Through this survey, we learned that our students come from 57 districts, and\n 23% of students identify as non-white. According to the Ohio census, this reflects a higher rate of racial diversity\n than the state of Ohio. Equipped with this information, we can set tangible goals to increase our reach in\n underrepresented communities. Additionally, we are working on gradual pay increases, especially for our student\n counselors, to raise weekly pay by $150 within 2 years. We added new support systems and policies to protect our\n LGBTQ+ students and our students of color, such as methods for reporting discrimination and ensuring safe\n roommates. In our 2022 survey, a parent told us about their student: \u201cthey liked being called their preferred name.\n They felt respected and safe.\u201d Although we are not done improving, we are glad to know that the students we are\n reaching feel comfortable with us. \n Project Budget and Financials Form - PS 2023 \n Completed - Aug 1 2022 \n Project Budget and Financials Form - 2023 PS \n Complete the following project budget tables. \n 9 / 14\n\nIncome \n Please describe your sources of income and their amounts in the table below.

How will you spend CAC funds? \n Tip: Indicate how CAC funds will be used. See list of prohibited uses of CAC funds on page #12 of the guidelines\n CAC funds support critical areas including: administrative personnel, artistic personnel, and production/event\n expenses. Of these areas, the majority of this funding will assist in hiring our artistic personnel (employees and\n contractors) who serve on the Summer Arts Program staff. As noted, this includes over 100 Cuyahoga County\n artists. These professionals are a key driver in delivering exception experiences to program participants.\n 11 / 14\n\n2. How will you proceed with your project if your project doesn\u2019t receive the full amount of funding requested\n from CAC? \n Tip: Most applicants to Project Support receive a portion of the funds they request based on their score. CAC does\n not expect any organization to carry out their full project on only a partial budget.\n If we do not receive the full amount of funding requested, we will need to limit the enrollment of our programs. As\n we are dedicated to ensuring one-on-one instruction, a smaller amount of funds available for exceptional\n professionals would have to result in a smaller amount of student numbers. In addition, we will be unable to fund\n our 2023 field trips to vibrant displays of art in the community, such as Cleveland Orchestra concerts and\n Playhouse Square performances. \n Upload your SMU| DataArts Funder Report - PS \n Completed - Aug 1 2022 \n For organizations whose maximum grant amount is $5,000 this section is optional.\n Required for organizations requesting more than $5,000.
