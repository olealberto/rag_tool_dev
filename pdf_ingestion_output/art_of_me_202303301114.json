Please note that your application can be\n saved at any point and you may return to the application to continue work. \n 1. Describe your project. Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and\n when and where your project takes place. \n The annual \"What is Power & Community?\" Story to Film Contest is for Cleveland youth in 6th-12 grade. We ask\n youth to identify who they are and who they want to be in their community through creatively writing a story that\n identifies and solves a problem that impacts their community, safety, family or friends. Cleveland youth creatively\n write stories with unique outcomes that explores topics critical to them such as teen relationships, bullying, drug\n use, gun violence, immigration, mental illness and identity. In the fall of 2021 over 100 Cleveland teachers will\n attend our What is Power and Community \n professional development curriculum workshop. Teachers use these lessons to help youth critical think about the\n challenges that prevent them for living longer and safer lives. In December 2022, youth submit their 1-5 page story\n to our contest. Our 50 member selection committee of community volunteers read and rate stories and the winning\n story is selected to be made into a film in the Fall of 2023. All youth who submitted their stories will be invited to be\n interns on the 50 member film set and have the opportunity to be mentored by film professionals to help make the\n film. They will also work with the local \n film school to make the film's behind the scenes. During Spring of 2023, the winning writer will work with an\n accomplished film director and writer to expand their short story into a 15 page shooting script. They will also work\n with the Cleveland coalition who are community leaders selected because they are most connected to the themes\n explored in the story. The Cleveland coalition will provide advice and insight for the characters and story. The\n preproduction of the film and behind the scenes film will take place in Spring of 2023 and production will happen in\n the Fall of 2023. In partnership with the Cleveland community and Cleveland Metropolitan School District the film\n will be produced in the community of the winning writer. \n 5 / 13\n\nPublic Benefit \n 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n We serve youth, grades 4-12 throughout the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. Students who participate in\n our program reflect the diversity of this region. Census data from students\u2019 zip codes indicate the majority came\n from neighborhoods where the median income is under $30,000; 11% of residents are college graduates. 53% of\n family households are led by single parents; 18% of neighborhood housing units are vacant. According to the\n 2015 Census, more than half of all people under 18 in Greater Cleveland live in poverty. During the preproduction\n and production stage we communicate frequently with the team of community, school and Cleveland coalition of\n volunteers who are experienced in the topics of the story to carry out the project. They also help recruit actors,\n crew members and provide locations for the production. We also meet with the writer's teacher, parents and school\n leaders to ensure everyone is involved in the process. \n 2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n All youth, especially in BIPOC communities are growing up in a society in which inequity is all too real and the\n extraordinary, including extreme levels of oppression, is becoming all too ordinary. Youth at the margins of society\n are often reduced to statistics based on zip code and are commonly defined by dominant cultural narratives that\n don\u2019t reflect their reality. Art of Me elevates their narratives, which are often silenced or overlooked, making them\n part of local and national dialogue. The Cleveland coalition, winning writer and teacher of the winning writer will\n work with Art of Me staff to create lessons and a study guide for viewers to use to better navigate the challenges\n explored in the film. The film will also be \n shown at film festivals and online for classroom use. The film will be used as a tool and beacon of light to present a\n new idea to the world of What Power and Community is and to inspire others to think creatively to solve issues\n impacting our community. \n 6 / 13\n\nArtistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n Youth have the answers to improve our present and future. Our work creates opportunities for these answers to\n shared through their authentic voice with the support of the local community. Our story to film program isn't focused\n on the best writer but the best story that challenges social norms while giving creative insight on how we can solve\n issues most impacting our young people, specifically BIPOC. Recent research states that youth in Cleveland have\n the highest rates of depression and suicide along with feelings of isolation, hopelessness and neglect. Our project\n challenges these social norms to inspire youth to write the future they would like to see in their community. The\n power of storytelling and filmmaking creates a living visual for others to see the steps on how they can also\n catalyze change. We also train our youth in public speaking while creating platforms for their stories to be seen at\n local film festivals, churches, schools and through our online streaming platforms.\n Organizational Capacity \n 4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.\n Our leadership team for this project includes Art of Me staff and many community partners including Cleveland\n Metropolitan School District (provide volunteers and staff for classroom support), and Cuyahoga Community\n College Creative Arts and Digital Filmmaking Department (provide film crew and film mentorship for youth).\n Art of Me leadership staff includes Stephanie Lassiter(executive director, executive producer and workshop\n instructor), Chanda Bynum(professional writer and workshop instructor), Rosemary Gramajo, (filmmaker, workshop\n instructor and marketing associate), Malcolm Lott (filmmaker and editor) and volunteers. During the film's preproduction, this team meets up weekly until the completion of the film. The production team of 50 people are lead\n by Stephanie, it is directed by a volunteer acclaimed director. The film is edited by a professional editor and led by\n Stephanie and the director. \n 7 / 13\n\n4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to\n accomplish within this project? \n Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and\n equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. \n Goal It is important for us to engage the community\n with this film to inspire change through the youth's\n storytelling. We will engage 75 community\n members in the creation of the film that answers,\n What is Power & Community. \n How will you know you have accomplished or made We will collect contact information for each\n member and communicate with them through the\n progress towards your goal? \n filming process and ask for their feedback.\n 5. Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an\n outside panelist reviewing your application? \n Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone\n who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,\n historical context., etc. \n Cleveland native Stephanie Wahome-Lassiter, founded AOM in 2018. She was the National Director of Education\n for Scenarios USA a nonprofit, in which she implemented the national education program for 9 years.

They will also work\n with the Cleveland coalition who are community leaders selected because they are most connected to the themes\n explored in the story. The Cleveland coalition will provide advice and insight for the characters and story. The\n preproduction of the film and behind the scenes film will take place in Spring of 2023 and production will happen in\n the Fall of 2023.

Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n We serve youth, grades 4-12 throughout the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. Students who participate in\n our program reflect the diversity of this region. Census data from students\u2019 zip codes indicate the majority came\n from neighborhoods where the median income is under $30,000; 11% of residents are college graduates. 53% of\n family households are led by single parents; 18% of neighborhood housing units are vacant. According to the\n 2015 Census, more than half of all people under 18 in Greater Cleveland live in poverty. During the preproduction\n and production stage we communicate frequently with the team of community, school and Cleveland coalition of\n volunteers who are experienced in the topics of the story to carry out the project. They also help recruit actors,\n crew members and provide locations for the production. We also meet with the writer's teacher, parents and school\n leaders to ensure everyone is involved in the process. \n 2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n All youth, especially in BIPOC communities are growing up in a society in which inequity is all too real and the\n extraordinary, including extreme levels of oppression, is becoming all too ordinary. Youth at the margins of society\n are often reduced to statistics based on zip code and are commonly defined by dominant cultural narratives that\n don\u2019t reflect their reality. Art of Me elevates their narratives, which are often silenced or overlooked, making them\n part of local and national dialogue. The Cleveland coalition, winning writer and teacher of the winning writer will\n work with Art of Me staff to create lessons and a study guide for viewers to use to better navigate the challenges\n explored in the film. The film will also be \n shown at film festivals and online for classroom use. The film will be used as a tool and beacon of light to present a\n new idea to the world of What Power and Community is and to inspire others to think creatively to solve issues\n impacting our community. \n 6 / 13\n\nArtistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n Youth have the answers to improve our present and future. Our work creates opportunities for these answers to\n shared through their authentic voice with the support of the local community. Our story to film program isn't focused\n on the best writer but the best story that challenges social norms while giving creative insight on how we can solve\n issues most impacting our young people, specifically BIPOC. Recent research states that youth in Cleveland have\n the highest rates of depression and suicide along with feelings of isolation, hopelessness and neglect. Our project\n challenges these social norms to inspire youth to write the future they would like to see in their community. The\n power of storytelling and filmmaking creates a living visual for others to see the steps on how they can also\n catalyze change. We also train our youth in public speaking while creating platforms for their stories to be seen at\n local film festivals, churches, schools and through our online streaming platforms.\n Organizational Capacity \n 4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.\n Our leadership team for this project includes Art of Me staff and many community partners including Cleveland\n Metropolitan School District (provide volunteers and staff for classroom support), and Cuyahoga Community\n College Creative Arts and Digital Filmmaking Department (provide film crew and film mentorship for youth).\n Art of Me leadership staff includes Stephanie Lassiter(executive director, executive producer and workshop\n instructor), Chanda Bynum(professional writer and workshop instructor), Rosemary Gramajo, (filmmaker, workshop\n instructor and marketing associate), Malcolm Lott (filmmaker and editor) and volunteers.

Will the event/activity be free or fee-based? How was this decision made? \n The story to film storytelling program is free for participants. This decision has been made because we serve youth\n who are living at or below the poverty level in Cleveland schools. We understand that this opportunity of\n mentorship, training and career development has a cost but it is also a unique opportunity for our youth to work\n with local and national film professionals. Our goal is to continue to seek funding support to make the annual\n storytelling program free for youth and families. \n Application Narrative Form - PS 2023 \n Completed - Aug 4 2022 \n Application Narrative Form - PS \n 4 / 13\n\nThe narrative is an important part of your application.

We ask\n youth to identify who they are and who they want to be in their community through creatively writing a story that\n identifies and solves a problem that impacts their community, safety, family or friends. Cleveland youth creatively\n write stories with unique outcomes that explores topics critical to them such as teen relationships, bullying, drug\n use, gun violence, immigration, mental illness and identity. In the fall of 2021 over 100 Cleveland teachers will\n attend our What is Power and Community \n professional development curriculum workshop. Teachers use these lessons to help youth critical think about the\n challenges that prevent them for living longer and safer lives. In December 2022, youth submit their 1-5 page story\n to our contest. Our 50 member selection committee of community volunteers read and rate stories and the winning\n story is selected to be made into a film in the Fall of 2023. All youth who submitted their stories will be invited to be\n interns on the 50 member film set and have the opportunity to be mentored by film professionals to help make the\n film. They will also work with the local \n film school to make the film's behind the scenes.
