In\n addition to physical injury, many victims experience anxiety, depression, self-blame, embarrassment, and\n fear. BWS\u2019s specially trained staff, interns, and volunteers meet the varying needs of each victim using\n practices grounded in Ohio Domestic Violence Network (ODVN) Promising Practices: Standards for Ohio\u2019s\n Domestic Violence Programs (2015). These principles provide staff with the tools needed to deliver\n meaningful services to victims. BWS staff complete 40 hours of specialized domestic violence training prior to\n working with victims. This training prepares staff to provide the support and information that victims need\n when they make the brave decision to call our 24-hr Crisis Hotline, enter protective shelter, or seek out any of\n BWS\u2019s crisis intervention services. BWS staff provide victims with the tools needed to overcome trauma and\n plan for safety, through the following crisis intervention services: \n a) 24-Hour Crisis Hotline: Specially trained staff are available 24 hours a day/7 days a week to provide\n victims with crisis intervention, inform callers of their rights, offer shelter services, schedule appointments,\n and provide support, options, and information. \n b) Emergency Shelter: BWS operates emergency (immediate) protective shelter and crisis intervention to\n any victim and their children who are fleeing domestic violence. Shelters are accessible to any victim,\n regardless of demographic, including adult males and persons \n with limited mobility. \n c) Transitional Shelter: BWS operates transitional (longer-term) protective shelter to any victim and their\n children who have fled domestic violence. Shelters are accessible to any victim, regardless of demographic.\n d) Rapid Rehousing: BWS provides rental assistance, supportive services, and crisis intervention to rapidly\n house victims and their children, who are homeless due to fleeing domestic violence, into their own safe and\n stable permanent housing. \n e) Case Management: Specially trained staff provide in-person crisis intervention, information, resources,\n and education on topics such as: securing employment, obtaining benefits, budgeting, healthy coping skills,\n the legal process, safety planning, victim rights, victim \n compensation, and other community resources. \n f) Support Groups: Specially trained staff provide confidential group crisis intervention in its shelters and\n throughout the community focusing on topics, such as: i) Self-Care and Healthy Coping Skills ii) Community\n Resources iii) Understanding Power and Control iv) \n Trauma related to Domestic Violence v) Red Flags of an Abusive Relationships vi) Effects of Domestic\n Violence on Children \n g) Youth Advocacy: Specially trained staff plan field trips, birthday and holiday parties, group activities, and\n provide age-appropriate crisis intervention, information on healthy relationships, healthy coping skills, etc.\n for youth residing in shelter. \n h) Justice System Advocacy: Specially trained staff help victims understand their rights and the processes of\n the legal system, provide crisis intervention, facilitate communication between the victim and justice system\n personnel, accompany victims to court hearings, assist with victim impact statements, connect victims to legal\n resources, provide support and education on the process when filing police reports, and provide survivors\n with information and support throughout the legal process. \n i) Individualized Safety Planning: Specially trained staff provide crisis intervention and help each victim plan\n for their safety using personalized strategies that work best for them and their individual situation, such as:\n providing phones pre-set to call only 911, leaving one\u2019s home safely, entering shelter, safety in court, work, or\n school, etc. \n j) Specialized Services for Underserved Populations: Using language interpreters when needed, specially\n trained staff provide crisis intervention, culturally-appropriate education, safety plans, resources, etc. to\n underserved populations (e.g., Limited English Proficient, LGBT, Persons with Disabilities, Geographically\n Isolated, etc.) \n Printed On: 27 March 2023 Human Service (for 2023) opens 4/15/22 4\n\nKate Robbins Battered Women's Shelter of Summit and Medina Counties\n Executive Summary* \n Share briefly the need and action to be taken if this request was funded. \n Deaths due to domestic violence have increased by 62% in Ohio according to the Ohio Domestic Violence\n Network. As a result of the increased severity in cases of domestic and intimate partner violence exacerbated\n by challenging economic and social conditions, demand for BWS' services is at an all-time high. BWS is the\n largest domestic violence shelter in the state of Ohio, and now that public health restrictions have lifted, the\n agency anticipates serving more clients from Cuyahoga County in 2022 than in the previous two years in the\n 154-bed shelter based in Akron. BWS ensures survivors can access the 24-hour crisis hotline, emergency\n shelter, and an array of comprehensive services 7 days/week, 365 days/year. Given the urgency and demand\n for BWS' services, we respectfully requests $10,000 from The Reinberger Foundation to support the ongoing\n core services to survivors and co-survivors of domestic violence, especially as BWS serves as a key resource\n for residents from Cuyahoga County seeking emergency protective shelter outside of their county of\n residence. Funds will support the costs of providing protective shelter and wrap-around services to victims of\n domestic violence and their children. Generous funding will allow BWS to continue being a source for shelter,\n support, and healing for residents of Cuyahoga County. \n Goals \n Project Goals* \n What are the goals of this request?
