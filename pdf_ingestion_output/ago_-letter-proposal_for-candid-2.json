  "abstract": "Funding Proposal: Stronger Nonprofit = Stronger Communities Academy for Grassroots Organizations\u2019 (AcademyGO) mission is Strengthening & positively impacting communities by convening, equipping, and guiding nonprofit leaders. What began in 2000 as a small networking group aimed at providing support to a handful of community-based organizations, quickly expanded to serving the Inland Empire region (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties) as a critical component of community programming infrastructure by establishing a nonprofit capacity-building ecosystem. We at AcademyGO envision an Inland Empire where leadership is strong, collaboration and innovation are the standard, communities thrive, and opportunity abounds for all. Working with hundreds of organizations on an annual basis, AcademyGO helps nonprofits learn and implement new skills and best practices, develop resources, and expand collaboration efforts to improve quality of life for Inland Empire residents. While the Inland Empire continues to be the epicenter of growth in California, the region is consistently low in nonprofit funding among other metropolitan regions. A continued funding partnership with your foundation will help us in supporting other community-based organizations, ultimately leading to increased supportive services for the community at large. AcademyGO respectfully requests continued grant funding in the amount of $150,000 for core operating support to continue to drive capacity efforts and eliminate the ceiling by providing empowering professional development to nonprofit professionals that ultimately strengthens the Inland Empire\u2019s nonprofit sector. A renewed partnership with your Foundation will support AcademyGO in accomplishing its mission through the following core grant objectives: \u2022 GOAL: Empower and strengthen the Inland Empire nonprofit sector. Objective #1: To train and equip 275 nonprofit professionals annually (with an annual 5% increase during the second and third years of the grant term) \uf0a7 Provide a year-round schedule of AcademyGO\u2019s signature workshops: The Fundraising Academy for Grassroots Organizations\u2122 (TFA) and The Grantwriting Academy for Grassroots Organizations\u2122 (TGA). \u2022 TFA is a 5-day course of interactive group workshops, peer learning exercises, assignments, and practical application. TFA is an approved provider for 27 CFRE points towards participant certification as Certified Fundraising Executives. \u2022 TGA is a 4-day course addressing grant funding challenges of local nonprofits. Participants learn grantsmanship best practices in grant writing, proposal preparation, program planning, logic models, budgeting, grant research, and receive peer and mentor proposal critique. TGA provides 21 CFRE points. \uf0a7 Provide a 4-session Grant Readiness course to prepare nonprofit organizations in becoming \u201cgrant ready\u201d. We know firsthand that grant writing is much more than persuasive writing \u2013 a successful grant also requires a strong organizational and financial foundation, relationship building, and key required attachments. Objective #2: Re-ignite the AcademyGO Cultural Competency Advisory Council and meet on a bi-annual basis. \uf0a7 AcademyGO\u2019s Cultural Competency Advisory Council is led by a diverse group of nonprofit professionals and currently has members from a variety of Inland Empire nonprofit organizations. The Council is charged with examining and analyzing AcademyGO\u2019s program strategies to ensure that practices are culturally sensitive, appropriate, and responsive to the needs of the Inland Empire community. While the pandemic posed challenges in our goals",
