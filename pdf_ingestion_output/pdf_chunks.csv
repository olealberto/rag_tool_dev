 Project Theory, Design and Plan 
 The Big Picture: Future of Electricity in Washington 
 Electricity prices will continue to rise as the electricity supply becomes more and more
 dependent on natural gas-fired turbines. In the U.S. 272 gas-fired plants are projected to be
 connected to the grid over the next decade. At the same time, domestic natural gas production is
 expected to peak in 2007, Canadian production in 2005, and Mexican production in 2011.
 Remaining natural gas reserves will be primarily in an unstable Middle East. (Rifkin, The
 Hydrogen Economy, 2002, p. 126-7) In this environment, a continued rise is in the market price
 of natural gas is almost inevitable. 
 For this reason, it makes sense to shift to energy sources that are not subject to market pricing, to
 so-called cost-based resources. Wind is such a source, and is abundant in Washington State.
 The price of wind-based energy is a function of the cost of wind-turbines and other infrastructure
 needed to develop a wind farm. Once these capital costs are paid, the energy source itself, wind,
 is free. In this sense, a wind farm is an insurance policy for low-income families against future
 volatility in the price of natural gas. 
 This project builds on a foundation of partnerships, working with partner utilities to shift from
 treating the low-income community as passive consumers of power to active developers of
 power. By developing wind-generated electricity, the low-income community gains access to
 cost-based energy, escaping the fluctuations of the natural gas commodity market.
 Target Population 
 The Project targets LIHEAP-eligible families heating with electricity. 
 According to a report prepared for DHHS by Roper ASW, there are 291,886 LIHEAP-eligible
 households in Washington State. Many of these households include members who are
 particularly vulnerable to heat or cold: 
  89,482 include an elderly person 
  73,051 include a disabled person 
  70,281 include a child five years old or younger 
 These numbers are based on Washington’s LIHEAP income limit of 125% of the Federal
 Poverty Guidelines. Using a 150% FPG standard approximately doubles each of the numbers
 above (663,034 households live below 150% FPG; of these 244,950 include an elderly person
 etc.). 
 Last year, 57,300 households received LIHEAP, leaving 234,586 eligible households (80%)
 unserved. Because of historically low-priced hydro-electric power, most Washington lowincome homes (73%) heat with electricity rather than natural gas (17%), with the balance using
 wood, oil, and other fuels. Although Washington once had some of the lowest priced electricity
 in the nation, since 1980 rates have doubled, even after adjusting for inflation. (See Figure 1.)

This understates the
 problem, because the rate increases have been disproportionate acoss the state, with some areas
 seeing significantly higher
 increases. For example, 
 from October 2000 to the 
 present, the largest public
 utility district in the state
 (Snohomish County 
 PUD), increased 
 residential rates by 50%. 
 When rates move with 
 such volatility, low- 
 income families are likely 
 to be left stranded . 
 Middle and high-income 
 families have been able to 
 migrate to gas heat. Of 
 new single-family residential construction, only 9% is all-electric, according to a June 11, 2003
 article in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. And while 53% of Washington’s homes heat with
 electricity (2000 US Census), fully 73% of low-income homes have electric heat. As often
 happens, low-income families have been left stranded in older housing stock, equipped for the
 energy markets of three decades ago. 
 Converting electric-heated households to gas heat would seem to be a solution to electric rate
 volatility. And in fact, several programs in the state are taking this tack, including the state’s
 LIHEAP program which can perform conversions when a household’s heating system is in such
 bad shape that it must be replaced. However, such conversions are expensive and must be
 balanced with the need for energy 
 assistance. 
 A large conversion program was 
 announced in June 2003 by Puget 
 Sound Energy (PSE), the largest 
 utility in the state. PSE estimates
 that it will convert between 20,000
 and 25,000 households from electric
 to gas. Given that the number of all
 electric households in Washington 
 was placed at 1.2 million by the 
 2000 US Census, even a “large” 
 program is a drop in the bucket. The
 program is incentive-based, with 
 $150 rebates on furnaces, $25 on gas
 heaters and free hook-ups. However
 a $175 incentive on a conversion that may cost $1500 to $2000 is too small to make a difference
 to many low-income families. Also, 73% of low-income families are renters. Typically, they
 are responsible for utility bills, so there is little incentive for landlords to convert rental units to
 gas heat.

 Even if all low-income households could be converted to gas heat, the problem would not be
 solved: PSE just raised gas prices 18% in March 2003. More and more, the gas and electric
 markets have become intertwined in Washington. Most of the new electric generation plants in
 Washington are gas-fired. As a result, natural gas prices have themselves become more volatile,
 and conversion to gas heat no longer provides the low-cost, stable utility bills that it once did.
 Increasingly, the cost of natural gas is linked to the cost of electricity. Figure 2 shows how
 natural gas prices at the Sumas Hub in Washington State have begun to track area electric prices.
 Even as residential energy costs are rising, Washington’s employment outlook is darkening. A
 US Bureau of Labor Statistics report for April 2003 shows Washington with the second highest
 unemployment rate (7.3%) of any state. The national rate for the same period was 6.0%.
 Washington is being particularly hard hit by the loss of high-paying jobs at Boeing. Because of
 cut-backs in the airline industry since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Boeing has
 been forced to lay-off 33,890 workers over the past 19 months and plans further cuts (Seattle P-I,
 6.20.03). Boeing is also facing stiffer competition. On June 20, 2003 the AP reported,
 “European plane manufacturer Airbus won a $5.1 billion order for up to 32 wide-body planes
 from Gulf carrier Qatar Airways yesterday, snatching another deal from Boeing….Until last
 week, the airline was considering its first purchase of Boeing planes.” Because Boeing is such a
 large employer in the Puget Sound area, the loss of these high-paying jobs has a negative ripple
 effect throughout the area. 
 And so low-income electric-heating households are caught between rising electric rates and
 negative job growth. 
 At the same time as companies like Boeing are downsizing, one industry in Washington State
 is poised for growth: wind energy. A recently completed wind map shows that Washington
 compares favorably with other states in available wind resources (see Figure 3 below; a more

 detailed wind map is included as Appendix K). In Walla Walla County, the State Line Project
 (the largest wind project in the world) has shown that wind power is competitive with fossil
 fuels. Technology and cooperative buying power have brought down the cost of wind turbines.
 State and federal legislation have increased incentives for developing renewable power sources.
 The wind industry is primed for rapid growth. 
 Assumptions 
 There are several assumptions we have made about the needs of our target population and the
 economic environment around them. The first is that the LIHEAP-eligible population is not
 going to decline. In fact we assume that given high unemployment projected to persist through
 at least spring 2005 (“Economic dark cloud lingers over Washington,” Seattle P-I, 6.20.03), this
 population will increase, making the need to find a permanent solution for reducing the energy
 costs of low-income households even greater. Our second assumption is that the amount of
 money for federal and state energy assistance programs, both LIHEAP and weatherization
 programs, will decline, again increasing the need for our proposed approach. Our third
 assumption is that costs for non-renewable electricity-generating resources (coal, natural gas)
 will rise over time. 
 Summary of Assumptions/Problems to be Addressed 
 1. Demand for LIHEAP far outstrips the need. 80% of families eligible for LIHEAP are
 unserved. Many of these families include vulnerable members. 
 2. Electricity rates have risen sharply, erasing many of the gains made by development
 of new nonfederal energy assistance funds. 
 3. 73% of Washington’s low-income households heat with electricity. 
 4. Conversion from electric heating to natural gas heating is expensive.
 5. Natural gas is increasingly used to generate electricity, linking the price of natural gas
 to electricity and making them rise in tandem. 
 6. Natural gas prices are likely to continue rising as production in North America and
 Mexico peak over the next 10 years. 
 7. Conversion to natural gas is at best part of the solution for low-income households
 stranded in housing built for energy markets of three decades ago. 
 Low-Income Inclusion in Planning Process 
 From the beginning this project has been designed as a collaborative project between the
 Washington Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development; Washington State
 Association Community Action Partnership (representing the CSBG/DOE 
 weatherization/LIHEAP network); A W.I.S.H; and utilities. Community involvement, including
 the direct involvement of low-income representatives, has been built into the project. The project
 Steering Committee has majority representation from Community Action Agencies, whose
 boards of directors are mandated to have one-third low-income membership. As members of the
 Steering Committee, low-income representatives will have an on-going role in developing the
 project and in recommending changes as necessary. Each of the thirty CAA’s partnering on this
 project, under the coordination of A W.I.S.H, has reviewed the project proposal all the way
 through the process leading to submittal to DHHS, and has had the opportunity to submit
 suggestions about the project design.

 As noted above, Washington has the second highest unemployment rate in the nation. Our first
 intervention will target Grays Harbor County, where the unemployment rate is 28% higher than
 the state as a whole. Other counties targeted because of their high wind resources also have high
 unemployment rates: 
  Klickitat 15.3% 
  Skamania 10.1% 
  Yakima 10.0% 
 (See Figure 4 below.) 
 Furthermore, in 2002 Yakima was selected as one of 40 Renewal Communities by HUD and
 will retain the designation until 2009. “Renewal Community” is a designation added to the
 Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community program (now designated the RC/EZ/EC Initiative)
 in 2001. The unemployment rate in Yakima’s Renewal Community (Census Tracts 1, 2, 6 and
 15) is 20%. Building a wind farm in Yakima would provide good-paying jobs during the
 development process, as well as provide low-cost energy to low-income Yakima households on
 completion. Yakima Valley OIC (the CSBG entity in Yakima), and Northwest Community
 Action Center (the CSBG entity for other parts of Yakima County) have reviewed this
 application and are project partners through the Washington State Community Action
 Partnership (WSCAP). 
 In Pierce County, part of Tacoma is a federal Enterprise Community and was also designated a
 Renewal Community in 2002. Unemployment in Tacoma’s Renewal Community is 18 percent,
 with 72 percent of the families in the area identified as low-income. Pierce County’s CSBG

 entities (Metropolitan Development Council and Pierce County) were active participants in
 REACh I, working with Tacoma Power to develop a new low-income energy assistance
 program. The Pierce County CAAs (both members of WSCAP) reviewed this application and
 are potential partners with the CSBG entities in Yakima County. (Yakima and Pierce Counties
 are contiguous.) 
 Project Strategy and Design: 
 Interventions, Outcomes, Goals, Impact [7] 
 Philosophy 
 The project treats the low-income community as active developers of power, rather than simply
 as passive consumers of power. To escape the volatility of market-priced energy sources, the
 project focuses on wind, a cost-based energy resource widely available in Washington State.
 Mission and Impact 
 The project’s mission is to increase the self-sufficiency of low-income families by securing
 stable energy sources and additional nonfederal energy assistance through participation in the
 rollout of the wind power industry in Washington State. 
 Final Goals 
 The mission can be achieved by accomplishing the following goals: 
 1. In partnership with utilities and the LIHEAP/Weatherization/CSBG Network, develop 12
 megawatts of wind power dedicated to low-income households. The 12 megawatts will be
 produced by facilities with a useful life of 20 years. 
 2. Increase utility contributions toward lowering energy burdens by obtaining subsidies for
 wind development dedicated to low-income households. 
 3. Reduce the energy burden of 12,000 LIHEAP-eligible families by 20% 
 4. For the 12,000 target families, reduce disconnects by 20%. 
 5. For the 12,000 target families, increase regularity of payments by 15%.
 6. For the 12,000 target families, reduce mobility (a predictor of homelessness) by 15%.
 7. Improve the health and safety of vulnerable households by reducing the energy burden for
 3,700 families that include an elderly person, 3,000 families that include a disabled person,
 and 2,900 families that include a young child. 
 NOTE: Each of the benefits described in Goals 3-7 above will be achieved annually for
 approximately 20 years, the useful life of a wind turbine facility. 
 Interventions 
 In general, REACh funds will be used as funding for high leverage activities such as partnershipbuilding, technical assistance, and grant writing. The effect of these activities will be to position
 the LIHEAP/Weatherization/CSBG Network at the table as wind power develops in Washington
 State. Actual funding for wind power construction will come from non-REACh funds.
 Just as public, cooperative, and investor-owned utilities share in development of other forms of
 energy generation, there will be various ownership models of wind energy production as the

 industry develops. The project will seek to influence the development of each of these models to
 ensure that the interests of low-income families are considered. 
 The project will have four primary interventions, explained below in more detail.
 1. Single Owner Model 
 2. Second Wind (Replicate Single Owner Model) 
 3. Cooperative Model 
 4. Process Participation 
 5. Tailored Energy Assistance Programs 
 Intervention 1: Single Owner Model 
 The project will help LIHEAP/Weatherization/CSBG CBOs acquire and operate their own windturbines, exchanging the energy produced for rate discounts/rebates to low-income customers.
 The project will work initially with one community action agency to develop a multi-turbine
 wind farm. The initial project will serve as a model for replication by other community action
 agencies in Washington State. 
 The initial agency is Coastal Community Action Program. During the applicant’s prior REACh
 project, Coastal CAP developed an excellent relationship with its local utility, Grays Harbor
 Public Utility District. Grays Harbor PUD enhanced its energy assistance fund as a result of
 discussions with Coastal CAP staff. The single-owner model grows out of further discussions
 between the utility and Coastal CAP on how to better serve low-income families.
 The key parties in developing the model program are 
  developer/owner of the wind farm: Coastal CAP 
  purchaser of generated power: Grays Harbor PUD 
  landowner: Grays Harbor School District 
  technical assistance provider: Northwest SEED (see Appendix J for a preliminary
 Memorandum of Understanding) 
 Project activities include: 
 First Scan 
  Review Washington wind map (www.windpowermaps.org/windmaps/states.asp). 
  Select areas with moderate to strong wind resource (class 3 or higher) and access to
 transmission lines. 
  Northwest SEED, which helped develop the wind maps, will provide technical assistance in
 identifying additional sites if needed. 
 Site Assessment & Acquisition 
  Perform anemometer test to establish actual wind speed (Note: The wind map is suggestive
 but not precise. Coastal CAP’s proposed site tests out at a higher wind speed than suggested
 by the wind map.): Northwest SEED will provide technical assistance. 
  Estimate monthly and hourly project output based on power curve of intended turbine and
 measured wind speed: Power production increases by a square function of wind speed; a 26

 blowing for two hours; Northwest SEED will provide technical assistance.
  Obtain site control: Coastal CAP has had extensive discussions with Grays Harbor School
 District; the School District is eager to partner and has identified a site that it will make
 available to the project for token rent. In return, the project will be used as an educational
 site to teach students about wind power and energy. 
 Permitting 
  Perform required environmental reviews of project to satisfy applicable U.S. Fish and
 Wildlife Service and state fish and wildlife requirements. 
  Perform required archaeological studies to avoid destruction of cultural artifacts.
  Contact Indian tribes in the project area to ascertain their interests, if any.
  Northwest SEED will provide technical assistance in all areas above. 
 Access to Transmission Lines 
  Obtain necessary access road and transmission corridor easements. 
  Identify proposed location of interconnection. 
  Establish status of transmission interconnection . 
  Determine whether any facilities construction is necessary. 
  Establish amount of available or reserved capacity. 
  Northwest SEED will provide technical assistance in all areas above. 
 Construction 
 (NOTE: REACh funds will not be used for construction, but only for staff time to secure
 financing that will in turn pay for construction.) 
  Identify size and number of turbines. 
  Obtain turbines from manufacturer: Project partner Western S.U.N. (see Appendix J for
 Memorandum of Understanding) will assist Coastal CAP in obtaining turbines and related
 equipment at a discount. Western S.U.N. uses the purchasing power of its members (which
 include PUDS, electric co-ops, and municipal utilities) to acquire and implement renewable
 technologies at the lowest possible cost through market aggregation. 
  Prepare site: Lay down access roads, turbine foundations. 
  Install turbines. 
  Connect to “the grid”: Make connection to transmission lines. 
  Northwest SEED will provide technical assistance in identifying the appropriate turbines and
 choosing a construction firm. 
 Financing 
 (NOTE: REACh funds will not be used for financing, but will be used to write grants, negotiate
 loans, request bonds and pursue other financing mechanisms listedbelow and in Section II (c)
 Holistic Program Strategies.) 
  Grant-based financing: This is the preferred method of financing. Potential grantors include
 private foundations such as the Energy Foundation, and government entities such as the
 Department of Energy. 
  Bond financing: Depending on final location of the project site, Coastal CAP may approach
 the County of Grays Harbor, Grays Harbor PUD, and/or the cities of Aberdeen and Hoquiam
 to sponsor a bond to cover upfront costs of the project, to be paid back with revenues
 generated over the life of the power plant.

This is not a priority
 resource because energy-generation projects are looked at sceptically since the Enron
 bankruptcy. Also, renewables projects are seen as riskier than traditional power plants (e.g.,
 natural gas fired turbines), with a proportionately high interest rate. 
  Sale of “Green Tags”: Green tags, also known as tradeable renewable energy credits (trc’s),
 provide a way to buy and sell the environmental attributes of renewable generation separately
 from the electricity generated. A market currently exists for green tags with wind power
 valued at from 1 to 4 cents per kWh. 
 Power Purchase Agreements/Low-Income Credits 
  Enter into firm contract for sale of electricity generated: Grays Harbor PUD is eager to
 purchase up to 6 MWh of power. 
  In return for the electricity generated, Grays Harbor PUD will provide a block of credits to
 Coastal CAP for an equivalent number of kWh. Coastal CAP will award these credits to
 low-income families applying for energy assistance. (Grays Harbor PUD is the primary
 provider of electricity in Coastal CAP’s service area.) 
 Key Immediate Outcomes for Intervention 1 
  Sign agreement with School District describing access to site. 
  Sign agreement with PUD to provide access to transmission lines. 
  Sign agreement with PUD to provide low-income credits enumerated in kWh (rather than
 dollars) in return for power. 
  Obtain all necessary permits. 
  Complete financing proposals targeting foundations, federal agencies, local government, etc.
 Key Intermediate Outcomes for Intervention 1 
  Break ground in construction of wind farm. 
  Coastal CAP obtains wind development expertise, allowing the agency to act as technical
 assistance provider to other LIHEAP/DOE WAP/CSBG CBOs. 
 Performance Goals for Intervention 1 
  Finish construction of wind farm and connect to grid, supplying 6 Mw of power dedicated to
 low-income families and controlled by CSBG CBO (Coastal CAP). 
  Lower by 20% the energy burden of 6,000 LIHEAP-eligible, electric-heated households by
 use of low-income credits, enumerated in kWh rather than dollars and therefore not subject to
 fluctuations in market pricing. 
 Intervention 2: Second Wind Model (Replicate Single Owner Model) 
 Even before the model wind farm is completed, Coastal CAP staff will have gained enough
 expertise to assist any of the 29 other members of Washington’s LIHEAP/Weatherization/CSBG
 network in developing their own wind projects. 
 Coastal CAP and Northwest SEED will offer workshops on wind development at regularly
 scheduled energy coordinator conferences and other venues sponsored by Washington State
 Community Action Partnership (WSCAP). 
 The REACh program will subcontract with “Second Wind” CBOs who wish to act as
 developers. The program will target CBOs that the Washington wind map suggests are in high
 wind areas (e.g., Yakima, Skamania and Klickitat Counties; see Figure 4 above). However, all

 CBOs will be eligible to develop projects. Agencies do not have to be in a high-wind area. They
 can act as co-developers of projects in other areas, especially if they are in the service area of one
 of the three large investor-owned electric utilities. 
 In such cases, collaborations among CBOs may prove most productive. The greatest successes
 were obtained in REACh I by groups of CBOs pooling their funds to work with the large
 investor-owned utilities (Puget Sound Energy, Avista, PacifiCorp). 
 Similar strategies will be helpful in the current project to connect projects to transmission lines
 and establish power purchase agreements. For example, the Community Action Center of
 Whitman County (poor in wind resources) might wish to collaborate with the Klickitat-Skamania
 Development Council (rich in wind resources). Even though the two service areas are not
 contiguous, both are served by Avista. 
 Subcontracts will be signed in the first year to allow two years to develop additional wind
 resources. 
 Once the subcontracts are signed, the development process will follow the same lines as
 Intervention 1 above, including: 
  First Scan 
  Site Assessment & Acquisition 
  Permitting 
  Access to Transmission Lines 
  Construction 
  Financing 
  Power Purchase Agreements/Low-Income Credits 
 Key Immediate Outcomes for Intervention 2 
  Second Wind CBOs learn more about wind power development 
  CBOs develop collaborations with other CBOs, utilities 
  CBOs are awarded subcontracts 
 Key Intermediate Outcomes for Intervention 2 
  Second Wind CBOs identify sites, sign agreements with utilities, obtain necessary permits,
 obtain financing 
  CBOs break ground in construction of wind farm 
 Performance Goals for Intervention 2 
  Finish construction of additional wind farms and connect to grid, supplying 3 Mw of power
 dedicated to low-income families and controlled by LIHEAP/DOE WAP/CSBG CBOs.
  Lower by 20% the energy burden of 3,000 LIHEAP-eligible, electric-heated households by
 use of low-income credits, enumerated in kWh rather than dollars and therefore not subject to
 fluctuations in market pricing.

 The development process is complex and can be intimidating. The 
 LIHEAP/Weatherization/CSBG CBOs will be offered a wealth of training and technical
 assistance, but some may still not wish to take on the process. 
 Intervention 3 is an option for CBOs who wish to participate but do not themselves wish to
 become wind developers. Under this model, the CBOs become part owners in cooperativelyowned wind farms with blocks of power set aside for low-income households. Western S.U.N.
 will provide training and technical assistance to CBOs on how cooperatively-owned power
 projects work. (See Memorandum of Understanding attached in Appendix J.) 
 In this case, the developer will be the Last Mile Electric Co-op (LMEC), a project partner (see
 Memorandum of Understanding attached in Appendix J). LMEC’s principal members are 15
 rural electric co-ops and municipal utilities. Thus, key parts of the development process,
 establishing a power purchase agreement and linking to the transmission grid, are ensured.
 LMEC has played a key role in bringing together potential partners to develop smaller scale,
 renewable energy power plants. For example, LMEC co-sponsored the 2001 Director-Manager
 Conference for rural utility leaders in Pasco, Washington. Approximately 100 rural utility
 officials attended the conference. In the same year, LMEC co-sponsored a conference on
 “Harvesting Clean Energy for Rural Development.” This conference was attended by 30 rural
 utility officials and 170 other participants, including potential funders, landowners, and CAA
 representatives. 
 LMEC will perform most of the activities described in Intervention 1 (site assessment and
 acquisition etc.). As in Intervention 1 above, Western S.U.N. will help the cooperative purchase
 turbines and related equipment at a discount. However, the CBOs will have a role in developing
 financing to secure their place in the cooperative. Funding mechanisms can include
 discretionary money controlled by the CBOs themselves, such as Community Services Block
 Grant funds, as well as external resources such as grants, bonds, and loans. For a full list of
 financing mechanisms, see Section II (c) Holistic Program Strategies. 
 The CBOs and Northwest SEED will also have a key role in shaping the power purchase
 agreement developed under the cooperative model. As in Intevention 1, CBOs will urge that such
 agreements be written to provide low-income credits numerated in kWh rather than dollars. As
 noted above, this will insulate low-income families who receive the credits from price shocks in
 the energy market. 
 Key Immediate Outcomes for Intervention 3 
  CBOs attend Western S.U.N. trainings on cooperative model of power plant ownership
  CBOs become comfortable with cooperative model 
 Key Intermediate Outcomes for Intervention 3 
  CBOs join LMEC cooperative 
 Performance Goals for Intervention 3 
  LMEC cooperative builds wind farm and connect to grid, with 3 Mw of power dedicated to
 low-income families and managed by LIHEAP/DOE WAP/CSBG CBOs. 
  Lower by 20% the energy burden of 3,000 LIHEAP-eligible, electric-heated households by
 use of low-income credits, enumerated in kWh.

 Intervention 4: Process Participation 
 This intervention builds on expertise developed in Washington’s prior REACh project, which
 developed over $12 million in low-income energy assistance by participating in the ratemaking
 process before the Washington Transportation and Utilities Commission (WUTC). By
 continuing to participate in procedures such as ratemaking and mergers before the WUTC,
 REACh can advocate for low-income interests and generate capital for low-income wind
 projects. 
 REACh will also participate in the permitting process. A number of gas-fired plants and large
 wind farms are proposed for development in the near future . Developments must obtain permits
 before breaking ground. This presents an opportunity for interveners to be heard. For example,
 Washington plans to require that developers of gas-fired turbines mitigate the carbon dioxide
 produced by such power plants. By participating in the permitting process, REACh can urge that
 mitigation be accomplished by purchasing “green tags” from REACh wind projects. In
 Washington State, new electric power plants with over 350 MW of generating capacity go
 through a state level review process overseen by the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council
 (EFSEC). Smaller developments usually go through a local permitting process. In REACh I,
 Blue Mountain Action Council secured $50,000 for low-income energy assistance by
 participating in the permitting process for a gas-fired turbine power plant. However, most
 REACh I CBOs participated only in ratemaking processes before the WUTC. Therefore, A
 W.I.S.H. will provide technical assistance to the CBOs on how to intervene both through EFSEC
 and at the local level .

 Key Intermediate Outcomes for Intervention 4

 Performance Goals for Intervention 4 
  Increase utility contributions to reducing low-income energy burdens by generating financing
 for low-income wind projects. 
 Intervention 5: Tailored Energy Assistance Programs 
 In REACh I, we found that ratepayer-funded programs of the large utilities often had to be
 standardized throughout a large service area to comply with regulatory requirements and
 administrative ease desired by the utilities. Therefore, the programs did not always best fit needs
 of the target population. In REACh II, because the energy generated is controlled by the CBOs,
 they can develop an energy assistance program best tailored to their local area. And programs
 can be easily modified based on experience of the CBO or projects in other parts of the state. A
 W.I.S.H. will provide technical assistance on models which do the following:
  Discourage family energy crises 
  Encourage responsible vendor and consumer behavior 
  Provide incentives that encourage payment of home energy costs 
  Provide incentives for vendors to help reduce energy burdens of target families
 For example, technical assistance will be provided on Clark County PUD’s Guarantee of Service
 Plan. This program has been documented to reduce delinquent balances, reduce shut-offs,
 increase regularity of bill payment, reduce write-offs and collection costs. For more detail, see
 the section on “Significant and Beneficial Impact” below. 
 The benefits generated by the project will be nonmonetary: energy assistance will be
 denominated in kWh rather than dollars. In this manner, clients are protected from the gyrations
 of the energy market. Provisionally, we have set the goal of reducing the energy burden of target
 families by 20%. This target may be adjusted up or down depending on experience gained as the
 project unfolds. REACh energy assistance will be combined with other programs operated by
 the CBOs to provide energy efficiency education and weatherization (funded through LIHEAP
 and DOE WAP) to maximize impact of benefits. All clients will receive energy efficiency
 education. Weatherization applications will be done according to established technical
 specifications, cost effectiveness tests, and applicable building codes. See II (c) Holistic
 Program Strategies below for more detail on integration of Intervention 5 with existing
 programs. 
 The target population for this project is low-income households in Washington State that are at
 the lowest end of the federal poverty guidelines. We feel our best strategy for serving them is to
 first move those at the higher end of the guidelines up and away from LIHEAP, since the
 program reaches only 20% of eligible recipients. By receiving a substantial reduction on their
 energy bills from REACh generated cost-based energy assistance, households at the higher end
 of the spectrum will transition off LIHEAP, to be replaced by families at the lower end of the
 guidelines. Per the state’s LIHEAP plan, through targeted intake, we will focus on families with

 Key Immediate Outcomes for Intervention 5 
  CBOs gain knowledge about energy assistance programs that discourage family crisis and
 present “win-win” situation for utilities and clients. 
 Key Intermediate Outcomes for Intervention 5 
  Energy assistance programs put in place to distribute energy to target households.
 Performance Goals for Intervention 5 
  Reduce the energy burden of 12,000 LIHEAP-eligible families by 20% 
  For the 12,000 target families, reduce disconnects by 20%. 
  For the 12,000 target families, increase regularity of payments by 15%. 
  For the 12,000 target families, reduce mobility (a predictor of homelessness) by 15%.
  Improve the health and safety of vulnerable households by reducing the energy burden for
 3,700 families that include an elderly person, 3,000 families that include a disabled person,
 and 2,900 families that include a young child. 
 Significant and Beneficial Impact 
 Using a conservative estimate of 28% turbine effectiveness, 12 MW of capacity will generate
 29,400 MWh annually (12 MW x 24 hours x 365 days x 28%). The average household in
 Washington uses 12 MWh annually. Therefore, each year the project could fully cover the
 energy needs of over 2,400 families. Or each year the project can reduce the energy burden of
 over 12,000 families by an average of 20%. Although the REACh project will last only three
 years, the average life of a wind turbine facility is 20 years. 
  Over its viable life, the project will generate 588,000 MWh of electricity.
  This is enough energy to reduce by 20% the energy burden of 245,000 families for one year.
  A LIHEAP program of equivalent size in Seattle (where the residential marginal block rate is
 8.66 cents per kWh) would require $50.9 million in funding. 
  Therefore, the project has a potential leverage of 50:1. 
  Even if energy costs rise over time, project impact will not erode, because benefits are
 denominated in MWh rather than dollars. 
 One of the key components to self-sufficiency is the ability to afford basic needs, such as
 heating, cooking, lighting, refrigeration, water heating and appliances. Wage earners and
 children cannot go off to school and work and perform successfully if they live in the dark,
 cannot cook food or have adequate warmth. This project promotes self-sufficiency by ensuring
 those basic needs are met by having affordable energy bills and energy-efficient homes and
 appliances, coupled with an education component. CBOs have noted that low-income families
 have a higher mobility than the general population. Often, a move is precipitated by inability to
 pay the utility bill. Once a family moves away from its support structures, its chances of
 becoming homeless greatly increase. Therefore mobility is a precursor to homelessness. By
 reducing energy burdens, the project will reduce mobility, and therfore homelessness, caused by
 inability to pay utility bills. 
 Once wind projects have begun generating power, CBOs have many options to choose among
 for deploying the energy assistance. They can tailor programs to the needs of their local target

 population. Among other models, the project will provide technical assistance on the Clark
 County Public Utility District’s current Guarantee of Service Plan. Under REACh I, most
 utilities felt the GOSP model to be too complicated. Research conducted by Clark County PUD
 shows that after implementing its GOSP program, delinquent balances fell from 67% to only
 37%, and power disconnects declined by 65%. The most impressive finding was that the
 regularity of bill paying by low-income households increased. Once low-income customers felt
 their utility bills were under control, they paid on average $23 more per month on their bills. Not
 only did the regularity of bill payments increase, the amount paid also increased. Low-income
 customers benefited through reduced shut-offs, uncertainty and administrative hassles. Utilities
 and their ratepayers saved significant costs through lower write-offs, administrative costs and
 increased customer payments. Thus, the model is created for a cost-effective investment on the
 part of the utility rather than a “give-away” program, a “win-win” situation for both low-income
 households and utilities. This data clearly indicates that the Clark County model program can
 avoid family energy crisis and provide financial incentives that encourage household payments.
 At the same time the model will show utilities that it is in their interest to reduce low-income
 family energy burden. We expect to have similar results when implementing energy assistance
 programs under REACh II. 
 The goal of replicability is embedded in the project. In fact, the project design calls for
 replicating the model program developed in Grays Harbor County in other parts of Washington
 State. Lessons learned in this transition will be applicable to replication in other parts of the
 country as well. As information is collected and results determined, a report will be developed
 that outlines both the process and outcomes of this project. That report will be distributed to all
 project partners (utilities, CBOs) and the Steering Committee. The reported is intended to be
 used as a marketing tool to encourage government bodies, utilities and CBOs across the country
 to pursue supply-side energy assistance models. The report will be written in a succinct, nontechnical, jargon-free manner for public consumption.
 The 60 investor owned and public utilities in Washington will receive this report. Follow up
 contacts will be made to discuss the report’s findings and answer any questions the utility may
 have. 
 A.W.I.S.H will put a report summary on its web site and make presentations at conferences such
 as the Energy Northwest Conference, which includes representatives from Washington, Oregon,
 Alaska and Idaho state governments and the U.S. Department of Energy. A.W.I.S.H will also
 make the report available to pertinent groups at the state (e.g., Energy Advisory Steering
 Committee of CTED) and national level (e.g., National Association of Community Action
 Agencies).

 (ii) energy efficiency education (funded by LIHEAP) 
 (iii) weatherization & energy system conversion (if appropriate) (funded by DOE WAP
 and state weatherization program) 
 (iv) family services: needs assessment, counseling, and payment plans related to energy

 The thirty LIHEAP/DOE WAP/CSBG agencies partnering on this project, under the
 coordination of A W.I.S.H, have put forward suggestions about project design and have
 reviewed the project proposal throughout the process leading to submittal to DHHS. Each of
 these partners administers many million dollars worth of community programs such as LIHEAP,
 DOE WAP, Head Start, health clinics, homeless housing, housing rehabilitation, case
 management, senior services and child advocacy. In addition, CTED ensures coordination
 through interagency agreements, regional roundtable meetings, and advisory groups. One of
 CTED’s major interagency agreements is with the State of Washington Department of Social and
 Health Services to provide client information, outreach and income verification services to local
 LIHEAP program contractors. Thus, this project will be integrated with the full spectrum of
 other services for low-income households in each community. 
 Partners and Roles 
 The program represents a collaboration of numerous partners representing the private for-profit
 sector, the private non-profit sector, and government. Project partners have committed
 $550,000 in match to the program. 
  Washington State Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development: The state
 entity that oversees LIHEAP will have overall fiscal, management, and reporting
 responsibility. 
  A W.I.S.H.: A private nonprofit representing the 30 CSBG/LIHEAP/DOE WAP entities in
 Washington will administer the project, coordinate partners, monitor contractors.
  Washington State Community Action Partnership (WSCAP): The state community action
 association will help coordinate with the community action network. 
  CSBG/LIHEAP/DOE WAP network: Many of these 30 entities include private nonprofits
 and county-based agencies, and will administer energy assistance funds developed under the
 project and develop wind turbines projects. 
  Coastal Community Action Agency: A private nonprofit will serve as model program for
 wind turbine acquisition, siting and operation and provide technical assistance to other
 community action agencies on development process. 
  Grays Harbor School District: A school district will provide land for the Coastal CAP model
 program and will use the site to teach students about energy. 
  Western SUN: A consortium of private and public utilities will provide training and
 technical assistance on cooperatively-owned power projects. 
  Last Mile Cooperative: An organization representing utilities and others interested in
 distributed generation will develop a cooperatively-owned model wind project.
  Northwest SEED: A private nonprofit will provide technical assistance on the viability of
 potential wind power sites and assist in contract negotiation with landowners.

 Coordination of Funding 
 REACh funds will be used to coordinate other funding sources. No REACh funds will be used
 for actual construction. Potential funding sources include the following: 
  Seattle City Light: Seattle’s municipal utility has a climate change committee that issues
 requests for proposals to acquire green resources and also meet other city objectives such as
 affordable energy costs for low-income families. 
  Green Tags: Also known as tradeable renewable energy credits (trc’s), green tags provide a
 way to buy and sell the environmental attributes of renewable generation separately from the
 electricity generated. A market currently exists for green tags with wind power valued at
 from 1 to 4 cents per kWh. 
  Foundation funding: Foundations such as Bullitt, Brainerd, the Bonneville Foundation, the
 Energy Foundation and many others are viable sources. 
  Bond Financing: Community Action Agencies may ask their local utility or local unit of
 government to sponsor a bond or other public loan to pay for the upfront costs of wind
 turbines and then pay the loan back from revenues generated over the life of the plant.
  Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZAB): As part of a Renewal Community/Enterprise
 Community/Empowerment Zone project, state or local governments can issue bonds at 0percent interest cost to them to finance public school programs with private business
 partnerships where the private business contributes money, equipment, or services equal to
 10 percent of bond proceeds. The federal government pays interest. For example, if Coastal
 CAP’s model program (which partners with the Grays Harbor School District) were
 replicated in Yakima (where there is a Renewal Community), the project would be eligible
 for QZABs. 
  Regulatory Proceedings: REACh funds will be used to participate in utility proceedings (e.g.
 rate cases, mergers, etc.) that have a prospect of funding this initiative. In many cases these
 proceedings are settled through a collaborative process and a settlement agreement.
  BPA Funds: The Bonneville Power Administration has five year funding cycles for the
 Conservation and Renewable energy program which funnels money to their customer utilities
 for these purposes. The REACh project will work with local utility boards on proposals to
 use some of these funds for our goals 
 . 
  Net Metering: Net metering has been approved by Washington’s legislature and can be a
 useful tool in making payments to the financing agents for sales of green kilowatts.
  Local Agency Discretionary Funds: Some CBOs have discretionary funds that can be
 invested in wind development and they have expressed interest in doing so.
  CDBG: The Community Development Block Grant is a potential funding source for CBOs
 working in partnership with local government.

 Renewable Energy issues State Energy Program Special Projects Solicitation with a focus on
 renewable energy sources. 
 Innovation 
  Project views low-income community as producers of energy, not just as passive consumers.
  Project partners include utilities, CBOs, and local government. 
  Interventions include a cooperative model for energy production. 
  Energy resource to be developed is cost-based (wind) rather than market-based (e.g., coal,
 gas, oil). 
  Project positions itself for success within an industry poised for growth in Washington, the
 wind industry. 
  Project develops energy assistance denominated in kilowatt-hours rather than dollars,
 insulating the value of assistance from energy price spikes. 
  CBOs can tailor energy assistance programs to meet local needs. 
  Resources developed under the project will continue to provide benefits for 17 to 20 years
 after the REACh project period. 
  The ratio of leveraged dollars to REACh funds is approximately 50 to 1. 
 Work Plan/Time Lines and Discussion of Critical Issues 
 Critical Issues/Potential Problems 
 Wind turbines are inaccurately perceived as a new, untried technology. For some organizations,
 the sense of being in the forefront of innovation may actually be enticing. However, we
 anticipate that a more common reaction will be caution. The following is a discussion of
 potential issues stemming from this reaction and plans for moving past it.
 Issue: Since private sources generally consider renewable energy projects riskier than
 conventional alternatives, the cost of capital for such projects is higher, and may increase
 with the advent of competition. 
 Plan: Pursue a funding mix that focuses on grants, bonds and green tag sales rather than
 commercial bank loans. 
 Issue: In Intervention 2, CBOs may be intimidated by the development process and reluctant to
 becoming developers. 
 Plan: Provide technical assistance and examples of successful developments. If this does not
 work, shift focus to Intervention 3 which relies on project partner Last Mile Coop to act
 as developer. 
 Issue: Local communities may be resistant to wind farms being located in their areas.
 Plan: Partner with rural networking groups (e.g., The Grange, the Rural Development Council,
 and Washington Rural Electric Cooperative Association) to provide education on the
 benefits of wind farms to the local economy.

 Academy for Grassroots Organizations’ (AcademyGO) mission is Strengthening & positively
 impacting communities by convening, equipping, and guiding nonprofit leaders.
 What began in 2000 as a small networking group aimed at providing support to a handful of
 community-based organizations, quickly expanded to serving the Inland Empire region (Riverside
 and San Bernardino Counties) as a critical component of community programming infrastructure
 by establishing a nonprofit capacity-building ecosystem. 
 We at AcademyGO envision an Inland Empire where leadership is strong, collaboration and
 innovation are the standard, communities thrive, and opportunity abounds for all. Working with
 hundreds of organizations on an annual basis, AcademyGO helps nonprofits learn and implement
 new skills and best practices, develop resources, and expand collaboration efforts to improve
 quality of life for Inland Empire residents. While the Inland Empire continues to be the epicenter
 of growth in California, the region is consistently low in nonprofit funding among other
 metropolitan regions. A continued funding partnership with your foundation will help us in
 supporting other community-based organizations, ultimately leading to increased supportive
 services for the community at large. 
 AcademyGO respectfully requests continued grant funding in the amount of $150,000 for core
 operating support to continue to drive capacity efforts and eliminate the ceiling by providing
 empowering professional development to nonprofit professionals that ultimately strengthens
 the Inland Empire’s nonprofit sector. A renewed partnership with your Foundation will support
 AcademyGO in accomplishing its mission through the following core grant objectives:
 • GOAL: Empower and strengthen the Inland Empire nonprofit sector. 
 Objective #1: To train and equip 275 nonprofit professionals annually (with an
 annual 5% increase during the second and third years of the grant term)
  Provide a year-round schedule of AcademyGO’s signature workshops: The
 Fundraising Academy for Grassroots Organizations™ (TFA) and The
 Grantwriting Academy for Grassroots Organizations™ (TGA). 
 • TFA is a 5-day course of interactive group workshops, peer learning
 exercises, assignments, and practical application. TFA is an
 approved provider for 27 CFRE points towards participant
 certification as Certified Fundraising Executives. 
 • TGA is a 4-day course addressing grant funding challenges of local
 nonprofits. Participants learn grantsmanship best practices in
 grant writing, proposal preparation, program planning, logic
 models, budgeting, grant research, and receive peer and mentor
 proposal critique. TGA provides 21 CFRE points.",paragraph_block,unstructured,376,0,False

 organizations in becoming “grant ready”. We know firsthand that grant
 writing is much more than persuasive writing – a successful grant also
 requires a strong organizational and financial foundation, relationship
 building, and key required attachments. 
 Objective #2: Re-ignite the AcademyGO Cultural Competency Advisory Council
 and meet on a bi-annual basis. 
  AcademyGO’s Cultural Competency Advisory Council is led by a diverse
 group of nonprofit professionals and currently has members from a
 variety of Inland Empire nonprofit organizations. The Council is charged
 with examining and analyzing AcademyGO’s program strategies to ensure
 that practices are culturally sensitive, appropriate, and responsive to the
 needs of the Inland Empire community. While the pandemic posed
 challenges in our goals of expanding this council and meeting regularly,
 we aim to re-ignite the council in 2023 and propose bi-annual strategic
 sessions meet our goals. Each session will include a conversation about
 barriers to services and recommendations to improve access for nonprofit
 professionals. 
 Objective #3: Develop and implement a Mentorship Program to compliment the
 The Grantwriting Academy for Grassroots Organizations™ (TGA) and establish
 two mentorship cohorts per year. 
  AcademyGO has offered TGA since 2015, and while proven to be
 successful as evident by post-program completion fundraising success, we
 recognize that more must be done to increase participant fundraising
 success. This pilot component would incorporate grant writing
 professionals to serve as mentors for TGA program participants. We
 envision these mentors would partner with participants to prepare them
 in advance of the course, serve as a sounding board during the week-long
 series, and provide extended guidance and resources post-completion. By
 incorporating a 1:1 mentorship approach to program follow-up, we
 anticipate a greater increase in grant success for all program graduates.
 We at AcademyGO are incredibly grateful for past support of our mission – especially during such
 an unprecedented season for all nonprofit organizations. We value your partnership and
 guidance, and appreciate your consideration of our renewed request to continue to empower

Mission statement 
 The Refugee Response empowers resettled families to grow roots, supporting them in becoming engaged, selfsufficient and contributing members of their new communities.
 Organizational history 
 The Refugee Response was founded by David Wallis and Paul Neundorfer, Ohio natives who worked in refugee
 camps across the world. Upon returning to Northeast Ohio, they launched a study of the Cleveland refugee
 community's needs and incorporated TRR as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization in 2010. They launched the Youth
 Mentoring Program and the Ohio City Farm, TRR's flagship programs, to support refugee education and
 employment. 
 As of 2022, The Refugee Response serves over 700 clients in an array of programs supporting education,
 employment and access for refugees of all ages. In addition to our flagship programs, The Refugee Response
 offers Teen Response for refugee students at John Marshall High School, the #Corner65 after-school recreation
 program, case management, content creation and tailored support for Afghans who arrived under humanitarian
 parole.

 1. Describe your project. Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and
 when and where your project takes place. 
 In March of 2022 The Refugee Response (TRR) moved our programming and office staff to a new headquarters
 and significantly expanded our space and facilities. We now have expanded space for art-making, education, and
 recreation for all of our clients -- many of whom are children and teens. Art is a central part of our programming
 here, and we are seeking new ways to activate our spaces with permanent art installations and art-making
 activities. Engaging refugee communities who struggle with mental health challenges related to their resettlement
 with art is a proven and powerful tool decreasing anxiety and feelings of anger and depression.
 As part of a the long-term relationships and support structures we build for and with our refugee clients of all ages
 we seek out opportunities to partner with Cleveland-based artists, and artisans, who have had a similar life
 experience. Cleveland-based, Iraqi-born Muslim visual artist Kubra Abbas Alhilali is a remarkable and successful
 artist who understands the unique experience of being a refugee. This project brings Abbas Alhilali to TRR to work
 closely with our youth clients to create new artwork in a series of 4 interactive workshops that will expand our
 clients' exposure to new forms and ways of making art, as well as connect them to a positive role model in the
 Cleveland community. 
 Further, this program will culminate in a public event and celebration with music, poetry, culturally specific food, and
 the exhibition of the artwork made in the workshops by our youth clients, as well as a celebration and unveiling of a
 new mural painted by Abbas Alhilali in TRR's new headquarters, building a permanent reminder and presence for
 art in our shared space.

 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?
 Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to
 demonstrate your project’s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by
 understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. 
 TRR serves people who have entered the US through the national refugee resettlement program or on
 humanitarian parole visas. TRR's educational programs serve refugee students in 4-12 grade in the Cleveland
 area, including Cleveland Metropolitan School District, Cleveland Heights, Lakewood and Parma. TRR is committed
 to placing the will of the communities we serve at the center of our decision-making processes. From the founding
 of our organization, core staff members were members of the refugee community. Today, roughly 50% of our staff
 comes from the refugee community. 
 Creative expression is a powerful vehicle for growth and we deliberately make space to support our youth clients in
 this area to build a richer community. This program and event will engage our youth clients, their families, and
 extended communities by bringing them together to celebrate Abbas Alhilali's work and the importance of art as a
 vehicle for interpersonal, emotional, and professional development.

How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and
 audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?
 TRR’s youth programs are based on authentic engagement and building personal relationships between staff,
 mentors; often guiding youth through some of life’s big decisions. Most refugees who enter through the
 resettlement program were displaced from their homes by war or persecution and have spent years living in
 refugee camps. According to the WHO, refugees are 10 times as likely as non-refugees to exhibit symptoms of
 post-traumatic stress disorder. 
 TRR has a number of art centric programs that demonstrate that many young refugees enjoy art and are excited to
 participate in art activities. Expression through art has been found to help refugees express and process the
 traumatic events of their past, and the stressful conditions of day-to-day life. Further, refugee teens and children
 who participate in the after-school classes will have the opportunity to learn from an artist who has been through
 similar experiences, and create art in a safe and empathetic environment of their peers.
 Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy 
 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.
 Both the workshops and the mural will be developed in coordinating with the featured artist, Kubra Abbas Alhilali.
 We will work closely with her to design a mural that is welcoming, inspiring, and that acts as a touchstone of the
 importance and possibilities of art for our community and youth clients. By connecting potential young artists early
 in their educational journey and lives with an established refugee artist, we hope to inspire them to imagine a
 broad set of possibilities for their lives, to encourage self-soothing and productive behaviors such as art making,
 and we also hope to create a mentorship pipeline for future generations of refugee artists in Cleveland. As we
 connect Abbas Alhilali directly to our youth refugee clients we are creating a link to the art world here in Cleveland
 that offers an expanded set of potential relationships and institutions to seek out and explore.

Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.
 The project is being led by Kubra Abbas Alhilali and TRR staff, Naila Paul, the Director of Youth Programs and
 Kate Nickley, Youth Mentoring Program Manager. 
 Kubra Abbas Alhilali is an Iraq-born Muslim artist and educator who arrived in the US as a refugee, she lives and
 works in Cleveland. She attended Amman’s Fine Arts Institute in Jordan and has exhibited her work in solo and
 group exhibitions. She is currently producing a number of murals and public art projects in the Cleveland area.
 Naila Paul is an educator and program leader. She directs the organization’s youth focused programming teams,
 including Teen Response and the K-8 Youth Mentoring Program, serving the educational needs of resettled
 refugee youth and families. 
 Kate Nickley works alongside the Youth Mentoring Program team to coordinate program services. She also
 organizes TRR's Community Advisory meetings and her professional background is in informal education, family
 programming and horticulture. 
 4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to
 accomplish within this project? 
 Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and
 equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. 
 Goal Our aim with this project is to bring an established
 refugee artist to TRR to work closely with our Youth
 Mentoring clients, offering them a rich and high impact
 experience making and thinking about art while seeing
 a change-maker in our community create a lasting
 impact -- interpersonally, and with the installation of the
 wall mural. 
 How will you know you have accomplished or made When the wall mural is completed we will be able to see
 and feel the impact of the artist's work on a daily basis.
 progress towards your goal? 
 We are building a home base for our client's and staff at
 our office and headquarters, and the mural is a visual
 manifestation of how important art and culture is to our
 work across all of our youth programs.

Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an
 outside panelist reviewing your application? 
 Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone
 who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,
 historical context., etc. 
 The activities and initiatives of the The Refugee Response (TRR) are broad in their scope but focused in their aims.
 As stated previously in the application we work to empower resettled families to grow roots, supporting them in
 becoming engaged, self-sufficient and contributing members of their new communities.
 TRR is a Cleveland based 510c3 founded in 2010 which operates 9 unique programs for individuals and families
 resettled through the national refugee resettlement program. In 2022 TRR will provide services to over 700
 individuals from over 12 different nationalities or ethnic identities speaking upwards of 20 languages and dialects.
 While TRR works with children and adults, in the past two years TRR has seen the biggest demand as well as the
 biggest growth in services directed towards teens and young adults. 
 A big part of what we do happens at the Ohio City Farm (OCF), a six-acre urban farm located in the heart of
 Cleveland, OH. Founded in 2010, the farm is a self-sustaining social enterprise run by TRR. The farm employs
 newcomers at an hourly rate significantly above average farm wages in the state. OCF has become a robust and
 resilient business through small-scale organic farming and a diversified means of sales including a 450-member
 Community Supported Agriculture Program. 
 What we do, at the core, is provide highly personalized services to our clients to help facilitate their resettlement.
 Our successes are our clients' successes.

 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?
 Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to
 demonstrate your project’s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by
 understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. 
 The Artography Project is designed to address and recognized the diverse health of the Cuyahoga County
 community by stimulating its ability to preserve and invent its culture. Our mission is investing in youth development
 through artist mentorship. 
 The direct community that we will serve through this project is the region of Cleveland and its various
 neighborhoods. Our primary audience are young-adults, ages 13-25. A deliberate outreach will solicit the
 participation from family, local residents, businesses, organizations, artists, and government officials.
 Many young adults in Cleveland have little access to revitalization processes in their community. Choosing specific
 locations for different reasons.This project becomes a diary of people places and things explored. Through
 Artography, we engage in visual dialog to build connections between the contrasted uses of imagination in
 constructing public benefit and the role of interpretation as a tool of shared innovated abilities.

 audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?
 The project enmeshes the support from the students from Sunbeam PK-8 School and Anton Grdina Academy
 which necessitates parental support and community engagement. Parents will be encouraged to partake in the
 composition of the photograph exploring various images using a disposable camera provided by the project.
 Students will be taught the basics of photography and partake in the development of the community wide project
 that will portray the diversity of Cuyahoga County. 
 It is obvious that in order to vitalize and sustain the growth of the community an initiative that affirms creative
 development is needed. The Artography project attempts to embolden public community value by acting as a
 catalyst for building multiple skills by moving youth towards a greater sense of self, providing a sense of meaning
 and purpose in their community as they work alongside artist mentors emphasizing various areas of development
 and readiness. 
 Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy 
 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.
 It is important that all people have exposure to artistic cultural events. We believe that our mission, “to engage
 youth to actively enrich their communities through development in art and growth in fine art appreciation” is in direct
 correlation with CAC’s mission. “We strongly believe” this project warrants public funds because the sole purpose is
 to inspire and cultivate the public to engage in ART. The Artography project address social needs and challenges
 by forming an artistic collaboration between neighborhoods, students and teaching art professionals. This project
 seeks to bridge the gap between the community and the artistic scope, building a visual, educational and social
 forum and most of all, the joy that a person receives exploring various creative ways to take a photograph.

 Our role as an Arts and Cultural Organization attempts to embolden community value by acting as a catalyst for
 building multiple skills by moving youth towards a greater sense of self, providing a sense of meaning and purpose
 in their community as they work alongside creative mentors emphasizing critical thinking, creative skills and
 important career readiness. 
 All programming will employ regional and local teaching artists of color whose work is of the highest artistic and
 cultural merit. The featured artists are a group of art professionals who exemplify and believe that the process
 towards positive change is cultivated and developed over time, rather than being something that one just
 mechanically instructs. 
 Creative workshops are structured so that participants find themselves having to work collaboratively with all other
 participants regardless of their differences. This process stimulates creative thinking outside the box to solve
 problems, create and execute impactful work.

4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to
 accomplish within this project? 
 Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and
 equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. 
 Goal The goal is to provide a platform for youth learning
 opportunities, art education and community
 outreach to residents of Cleveland. Including young
 people as meaningful contributors in the social and
 economic aspects of community building must not
 be overlooked and cannot be left to schools and
 parents alone. Engaging youth is a dual benefit: it
 brings more adults into the picture. This gets people
 more involved in community affairs by helping to
 improve conditions for youth.

 on existing regional needs within the lack of art-based

 Based on internal to external goals we survey and
 evaluate our program participants and measure these

 • Engaging youth to enrich their communities
 through art development 
 • Increase knowledge of contributions to the
 narration of art. 
 • Sustain the growth of art and enmeshing youth
 to enrich their neighborhoods.

 100 Black Men Metropolitan Houston utilizes a unique collaboration model that is tailored
 to our mission: “To improve the quality of life of our communities and enhance educational and
 economic opportunities for all African Americans. Creating order out of fragmentation by
 providing a single point of entry for the community residents and coordinating the activities of a
 diverse set of member organizations. 
 The 100 Black Men Metropolitan Houston and its community-based Economic workforce
 development pillar have a collaborative solution to provide Black and Latino Houstonians with
 sustainability resources, education, and skills training for the future of work in high demand
 industries that increase quality of life. 
 The 100 Black of America has four main pillars as its mission: Mentoring, which includes
 comprehensive programs that mentor children and youth through a worldwide network of
 chapters; Education, where the organization has been educating and empowering youth for over
 three decades; Health & Wellness, where the organization’s goals are to raise awareness, provide
 access to health care information that will ultimately promote behavior change resulting in
 healthier lifestyles; and Economic Empowerment, which promotes economic self-sufficiency
 through financial literacy, family wealth building, and entrepreneurship among lower socioeconomic residents within the greater Houston and surrounding areas.
 The chapter’s primary vehicle for connecting with youth is through what is titled Mentoring the
 100 Way. Our programming for mentoring was started in 1994. Mentoring the 100 Way focuses
 on topics such as self-esteem, career exploration, entrepreneurship, healthy lifestyle choices, and
 financial literacy; 185 mentees are served in this program. The agency is seeking programmatic
 funding to continue this program with new modules and components – for our middle school and
 high school mentees, for their parents and the larger community, and for our Collegiate 100 and
 Emerging 100 mentees – with the assistance of these grant funds. These funds will
 subsequentially attribute to the academic success, retention, graduation, and college admission
 rates of our mentees. 
 A detailed description of the proposed project or activity. 
 The Houston 100 has established relationships with the (5) local area targeted high schools.
 These schools represent diversity in geographic location, and each school serves a high needs
 community. These are established partnerships with strong relationships that we continue to
 nurture. All partners parties involved have been satisfied with our programmatic outcomes and
 have expressed a strong willingness to continue to work together. Funding for this project will be
 used for infrastructure to expand mentoring activities and collaboration with partners to promote.
 We launched our inaugural 100 Jobs for 100 Mentees Initiative, which served the Collegiate 100
 students from Prairie View A&M University, Texas Southern University, and the University of
 Houston. It emphasized interview skills, resume writing, and professional etiquette in addition to
 approximately 50 representatives from different corporate partners who helped the Collegiate
 100 members develop their ""elevator pitches"" and conducted mock interviews. We collaborated
 with several corporate partners for the program, and they served as mock interviewers. The 100,
 Emerging 100 and our Collegiate 100 chapters also participated in the Curators event, which",paragraph_block,unstructured,515,1,False

Additionally, 100 Black Men
 Metropolitan Houston utilizes a unique collaboration model that is tailored to our mission to
 prevent mission drift. 
 We have identified the biggest need for the organization is funding for infrastructure; to expand
 mentoring activities and collaboration with partners to promote the good works within the
 community of at-risk young men of color. Our mentoring program centers on our Four Pillars:
 education; mentoring; health and wellness and economic empowerment. Our mentoring activities
 generally occur every second and fourth Saturday during the HISD school year. We hope our
 partners will invest in us, listen to us and advocate for us. The 100 Black Men of Metro Houston
 is a group of “Real Men Giving Real Time.” Our motto is “What they see is what they’ll be.”
 Consequently, we believe in being present in the lives of our youth on a persistent and constant
 basis. Our mentoring program is held every second and fourth Saturday from August through June,
 which allows us to provide consistency in our mentees’ lives. We encourage our partners to
 participate and collaborate in these programs and to help develop programs that build synergies
 between the 100 Black Men of Metro Houston’s stated goals and objectives and those of the
 Houston, Texas and any other partner agencies. 
 Specific Programs Past and Upcoming Programs 
 1. 100 Jobs for 100 Mentees Initiative (February 2022)- We recently launched our 100
 Jobs for 100 Mentees Initiative designed and targeted towards the Collegiate 100 to prepare
 them for a competitive job market by focusing on resume writing, interview skills,
 professional etiquette and providing mock interviews that were conducted by over 50
 volunteers from various corporate partners. It emphasized interview skills, resume writing,
 and professional etiquette in addition to approximately 50 representatives from different
 corporate partners who helped the Collegiate 100 members develop their ""elevator pitches""
 and conducted mock interviews. We collaborated with several corporate partners for the
 program, and they served as mock interviewers. We also provide a Leadership Conference
 for the Collegiate 100 that tackles racial injustice, policing, social media, personal
 branding, leadership and elevator pitches. 
 2. Life After High School Sports (April 2022) - The purpose of this program is to educate
 middle and high school students about post-secondary careers in sports-related fields, and
 to help prepare them for the challenges of playing college or possibly professional sports.
 Alternatively, we give student athletes educational and career options to consider in the
 event of an injury or not reaching the professional athletics arena. Thus, it seeks to teach
 alternatives once an athletic career has run its course or if athletics is no longer an option.
 Our panel includes former professional athletes, coaches and a collaboration with the
 Houston Dynamo/Dash Foundation, Astros Youth Academy, and the Houston Texans to
 continue our focus on career exploration and social justice.

 American community. It specifically addresses health disparities in the community,
 COVID-19 and focuses on mental health and mental health awareness. 
 4. Mentee Camping Trip (July 2022)- Annually, the 100 Black Men of Metropolitan
 Houston host a camping trip to expose African- American young men to the joys of the
 great outdoors. For several years, Dr. Matthew W. Plummer has hosted this experience, Jr
 and his business partner our President-Elect Dr. Justin Washington. The WashingtonPlummer Ranch is located in Edna, Texas. The ranch was established by two former slaves
 in 1888 and is still operating today as a farm, cattle ranch, and hunting reserve. The mentees
 are instructed to bring sleeping bags as many are taught to pitch tents for sleeping for the
 first time. Cell phones and electronics are prohibited so that the mentees can connect with
 nature, the mentors, and fellow mentees. 
 5. Mentees in Film (September 2022) – This program will focus on educational awareness
 and encourage mentees to strive for academic achievement while providing an opportunity
 to audition for casting in theater arts. 
 Additionally, this program will treat our mentees and mentees from other 100 chapters in
 the region to a discussion with author and motivational speaker - Dondre Whitfield. In
 2020, with over thirty years in the entertainment business as an Emmy-award nominated
 actor, a husband, father, and leader - Mr. Whitfield wrote a book Male vs. Man: How to
 Honor Women, Teach Children, and Elevate Men to Change the World. This book
 challenges men and young boys to become leaders in the world, our communities, and
 homes. All guests are asked to join 100 BMOH as Mr. Whitfield will challenge us as Men
 to lead through a provocative conversation on servant leadership. 
 Chapter Six of Mr. Whitfield's Book ""You First: Defining Servant Leadership"" will be the
 basis of the session's conversation and has been chosen by the 100 BMOH Education
 Committee as the 2022 Senior Mentee Scholarship essay writing topic subject.

 In 2021, BWS's Summit County Domestic Violence shelter served 22 clients from Cuyahoga County. All shelter
 clients receive daily resources, support, and encouragement—celebrating each step taken towards reaching
 self-sufficiency and a life free from abuse. The average length of stay for each client is 42 days, and a shelter
 night costs approximately $39.05 each night per client for the agency, estimating $36,000 of our shelter
 resources were dedicated to clients from Cuyahoga County in 2021. BWS anticipates serving more clients
 from Cuyahoga County in 2022 than in the previous two years, as the shelter returns to full capacity. A
 contribution from The Reinberger Foundation would contribute significantly to BWS' ability to serve the
 clients from Cuyahoga County at a time when BWS has experienced severe federal funding cuts, while
 simultaneously anticipating an increase in need for shelter services. 
 Fleeing one’s home, coupled with the threat of future violence, is traumatic. In addition to physical injury,
 many survivors experience anxiety, depression, self-blame, embarrassment, fear, and economic instability.
 Fortunately, BWS’s specially trained staff, interns, and volunteers are available to provide the special
 attention and compassion to meet the varying needs of each survivor. Staff adhere to and employ practices
 grounded in Ohio Domestic Violence Network (ODVN) Promising Practices: Standards for Ohio’s Domestic
 Violence Programs and Trauma- Informed Care. When survivors make the brave decision to pick up the
 phone and call our 24-hr crisis hotline, these principles prepare staff, interns, and volunteers to answer each
 hotline call with compassion, cultural and linguistic sensitivity to our diverse clients’ needs, and knowledge of
 community resources. For those who determine shelter is their best option to keep themselves and their
 children safe, our staff is available to provide each adult and child with support, empathy, and comfort while
 addressing their basic needs and safety. 
 BWS measures its successes both quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative statistics measure the number
 of clients served and their self-identified demographics while a voluntary and anonymous qualitative client
 feedback survey measures satisfaction with services and knowledge gained through the program. Upon
 program exit, adult survivors may complete the anonymous client feedback survey measuring qualitative
 data relative to safety planning, community resources, rights, program accessibility, and satisfaction.
 Specifically, this program’s goals for 2022 are: 
 1. Provide a minimum of 650 survivors with protective shelter, basic human needs, and the resources needed
 to achieve self-sufficiency through the Summit & Medina Shelter programs (survivors come from throughout
 the state, including Cuyahoga County) between 01/01/22 – 12/31/22. 
 2. A minimum of 92% of adult survivors will report on an anonymous client feedback survey that they now
 have more strategies for enhancing their safety during or following stays in our Protective Shelter Program
 from 01/01/22 – 12/31/22. 
 3. A minimum of 92% of adult survivors will report on an anonymous client feedback survey that they have
 an increased awareness of community resources available to help them achieve self-sufficiency following
 stays in our Protective Shelter Program from 01/01/22 – 12/31/22.

 Additional details you need to share 
 If you felt constrained by the initial application you may provide additional details. If your initial application (LOI)
 provided the information we need on the project, do not feel it necessary to give us practice with our reading!
 The emotional turmoil that individuals experience when leaving an abusive relationship is often traumatic. In
 addition to physical injury, many victims experience anxiety, depression, self-blame, embarrassment, and
 fear. BWS’s specially trained staff, interns, and volunteers meet the varying needs of each victim using
 practices grounded in Ohio Domestic Violence Network (ODVN) Promising Practices: Standards for Ohio’s
 Domestic Violence Programs (2015). These principles provide staff with the tools needed to deliver
 meaningful services to victims. BWS staff complete 40 hours of specialized domestic violence training prior to
 working with victims. This training prepares staff to provide the support and information that victims need
 when they make the brave decision to call our 24-hr Crisis Hotline, enter protective shelter, or seek out any of
 BWS’s crisis intervention services. BWS staff provide victims with the tools needed to overcome trauma and
 plan for safety, through the following crisis intervention services: 
 a) 24-Hour Crisis Hotline: Specially trained staff are available 24 hours a day/7 days a week to provide
 victims with crisis intervention, inform callers of their rights, offer shelter services, schedule appointments,
 and provide support, options, and information. 
 b) Emergency Shelter: BWS operates emergency (immediate) protective shelter and crisis intervention to
 any victim and their children who are fleeing domestic violence. Shelters are accessible to any victim,
 regardless of demographic, including adult males and persons 
 with limited mobility. 
 c) Transitional Shelter: BWS operates transitional (longer-term) protective shelter to any victim and their
 children who have fled domestic violence. Shelters are accessible to any victim, regardless of demographic.
 d) Rapid Rehousing: BWS provides rental assistance, supportive services, and crisis intervention to rapidly
 house victims and their children, who are homeless due to fleeing domestic violence, into their own safe and
 stable permanent housing. 
 e) Case Management: Specially trained staff provide in-person crisis intervention, information, resources,
 and education on topics such as: securing employment, obtaining benefits, budgeting, healthy coping skills,
 the legal process, safety planning, victim rights, victim 
 compensation, and other community resources. 
 f) Support Groups: Specially trained staff provide confidential group crisis intervention in its shelters and
 throughout the community focusing on topics, such as: i) Self-Care and Healthy Coping Skills ii) Community
 Resources iii) Understanding Power and Control iv) 
 Trauma related to Domestic Violence v) Red Flags of an Abusive Relationships vi) Effects of Domestic
 Violence on Children 
 g) Youth Advocacy: Specially trained staff plan field trips, birthday and holiday parties, group activities, and
 provide age-appropriate crisis intervention, information on healthy relationships, healthy coping skills, etc.
 for youth residing in shelter. 
 h) Justice System Advocacy: Specially trained staff help victims understand their rights and the processes of
 the legal system, provide crisis intervention, facilitate communication between the victim and justice system
 personnel, accompany victims to court hearings, assist with victim impact statements, connect victims to legal
 resources, provide support and education on the process when filing police reports, and provide survivors
 with information and support throughout the legal process. 
 i) Individualized Safety Planning: Specially trained staff provide crisis intervention and help each victim plan
 for their safety using personalized strategies that work best for them and their individual situation, such as:
 providing phones pre-set to call only 911, leaving one’s home safely, entering shelter, safety in court, work, or
 school, etc. 
 j) Specialized Services for Underserved Populations: Using language interpreters when needed, specially
 trained staff provide crisis intervention, culturally-appropriate education, safety plans, resources, etc. to
 underserved populations (e.g., Limited English Proficient, LGBT, Persons with Disabilities, Geographically
 Isolated, etc.)

 Executive Summary* 
 Share briefly the need and action to be taken if this request was funded. 
 Deaths due to domestic violence have increased by 62% in Ohio according to the Ohio Domestic Violence
 Network. As a result of the increased severity in cases of domestic and intimate partner violence exacerbated
 by challenging economic and social conditions, demand for BWS' services is at an all-time high. BWS is the
 largest domestic violence shelter in the state of Ohio, and now that public health restrictions have lifted, the
 agency anticipates serving more clients from Cuyahoga County in 2022 than in the previous two years in the
 154-bed shelter based in Akron. BWS ensures survivors can access the 24-hour crisis hotline, emergency
 shelter, and an array of comprehensive services 7 days/week, 365 days/year. Given the urgency and demand
 for BWS' services, we respectfully requests $10,000 from The Reinberger Foundation to support the ongoing
 core services to survivors and co-survivors of domestic violence, especially as BWS serves as a key resource
 for residents from Cuyahoga County seeking emergency protective shelter outside of their county of
 residence. Funds will support the costs of providing protective shelter and wrap-around services to victims of
 domestic violence and their children. Generous funding will allow BWS to continue being a source for shelter,
 support, and healing for residents of Cuyahoga County.

 Organizational Overview 
 The organizational overview gives panelists a glimpse into your organization. 
 Mission Statement 
 Our mission is to utilize dance to successfully bridge the gap between Northeast Ohio (NEO) youth and higher
 education at Historically Black Colleges & Universities, while increasing the awareness of obtainable dance
 careers. 
 Organization Overview and History 
 Remember: the panelists reviewing your application are from outside of Northeast Ohio. You should present a clear
 overview of your organization to someone unfamiliar with this region. 
 Buck Out Cleveland was started in an effort to offer dance training to high schoolers interested in dancing as a
 part of a marching band dance line in college. Since 2019, we have evolved within our in-studio space, after
 school time at four different school sites, City of Cleveland recreation centers, and our annual Halftime Dance
 Showcase that features performances by local dance teams and hosts about 200 in-person attendees and over
 1,000 virtual audience members.

 Black/African American 
 Please describe your organization’s programming, demonstrating how it is deeply rooted in the experiences of
 the culturally specific population you serve. 
 Buck Out Cleveland specializes in teaching Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCU) Dance-Line style of
 dance, commonly known as dance majorette. This dance style is performed explicitly by marching band auxiliary
 members at HBCUs. This dance style combines high-energy gymnastics, Hip-Hop, Jazz, and Ballet. For dancers
 that are old enough, we offer audition preparation for selection to the dance teams associated with these
 schools/dance teams. Buck Out Cleveland is also explicitly committed to connecting students to Historically Black
 Colleges and Universities, spaces ideal for nurturing and supporting Black students. Through our connections with
 community organizations, we can offer educational assistance and access to financial resources to our network of
 eligible students. Lastly, Halftime Dance Showcase features performances by local dance teams specializing in the
 HBCU style of dance and pays tribute to these Black institutions through dance performances.

Define your community 
 Who does your organization regularly engage? Whose feedback informs your decisions?
 Buck Out Cleveland serves aspiring dancers from historically under-resourced communities in northeast Ohio,
 including inner-city Cleveland and East Cleveland, Ohio. Our primary community is young women between the
 ages of nine and nineteen. We aim to provide exposure for students who would not otherwise have access to
 high-quality professional dance training. The needs of our dancers informs what we prioritize and how we plan our
 programming. 
 2. How does your organization build relationships with and respond to its defined community?
 Buck Out Cleveland works with schools, community organizations, and individuals to identify Buck Out program
 participants. For example, Buck Out provided professional instruction to dance teams at Glenville High School,
 Warrensville Heights High School, Euclid High School, and Central Middle School. The delivery of professional
 education from Buck Out Cleveland’s instructors led several students to enroll in Buck Out programs and to
 participate in Buck Out Cleveland's annual showcase entitled ""Halftime."" 
 The organization also relies heavily on the input and support of the community to execute its programs. The Buck
 Out Cleveland team is made up of Cleveland and East Cleveland residents with a deep understanding of
 community needs. The team intentionally engages community organizations and residents through public forums
 and social media. Furthermore, Buck Out Cleveland has a booster club composed of parents and supporters of the
 organization.

Describe how your organization reaches out to the wider public. 
 How might a new resident learn about your work? How do you market your pubic-facing events?
 Buck Out Cleveland focuses on reaching Black women and girls interested in dance through digital platforms
 including Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Buck Out Cleveland’s audience has grown consistently for over six
 years. Captivating concept videos and distinctive branding keep engagement and awareness of programs high.
 The team also leverages relationships with influencers in the HBCU dance community to draw people to the
 organization. The organization has an active social media presence with over 5,300 Instagram followers, 210+
 YouTube subscribers, and over 550 Facebook followers. In addition, Buck Out Cleveland maintains connections
 with media outlets that aid in spreading the word about upcoming events and the organization’s impact. Student
 dancers and their parents also lead word-of-mouth and community engagement efforts.
 Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy Narratives 
 CAC defines Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy as an organization’s ability to create quality, mission-driven work that
 inspires and challenges its community. 
 1. Describe the team of arts and culture professionals that carries out your work.
 LaChanee Davis leads Buck Out Cleveland. LaChanee is a graduate of Alabama State University and a former
 Stingette. She is also a former dancer and a current assistant coach for the NBA Cleveland Cavaliers dance
 department. LaChanee aspires to strengthen, empower, and inspire motivated individuals by developing their
 talents in dance. The Buck Out Cleveland team also includes former and current professional and collegiate
 dancers and current students who support programming and administration. Students lead the enrollment and
 recruitment process for the organization. 
 Most of the administrative work of the organization is done by the Director, LaChanee Hipps, along with skilled
 interns from local universities and dance students.

Describe how you engage individuals and/or organizations in authentic partnerships. How do you build the
 capacity of arts and culture professionals? 
 Buck Out Cleveland works with local schools, community organizations, and individuals to identify students
 participating in programming. Without those connections, students would likely miss the opportunity to be a part of
 Buck Out Cleveland. Buck Out Cleveland also has formal partnerships with The City of Cleveland and Rainey
 Institute to provide dance classes for community members free of charge. These partnerships also expand Buck
 Out’s reach in the community. 
 3. Describe a recent programmatic highlight that celebrates the unique artistic contributions of your
 organization. How did this work inspire the community to think creatively and/or differently?
 The organization recently created a viral concept video entitled ""Freedom."" The idea of ""Freedom"" was sparked by
 the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter Movement. Not only did the movement cause canceled
 rehearsals and curfew mandates from the riots happening in downtown Cleveland, but it also caused a lot of
 emotional trauma for the dancers as they noticed the changes in the dynamic of their community and the world.
 When LaChanee, asked for suggestions from dancers on the theme for their first visual concept, the dancers felt
 the need to dedicate a performance to this movement to provide an empowering and enlightening message. The
 ""Freedom"" video inspired the dancers to use their art as a form of protest and expression. The video also inspired
 the broader community to use their respective platforms to make a difference. 
 4. How do you reflect on your current programming? What feedback or changes do you plan to implement in
 the next two years? 
 Buck Out Cleveland often reflects on its programming to ensure that we meet our dancers' holistic needs. While the
 organization has successfully grown its programmatic reach, it relies heavily on volunteers to operate. Currently, our
 volunteer Executive Director leads our programmatic and administrative efforts. Over the next two years, we plan to
 provide a livable salary to the Executive Director and other staff members to ensure that resources are available to
 execute programs at maximum capacity. 
 Buck Out Cleveland has peaked as a small nonprofit organization with primarily volunteer staff members. We
 gained momentum with our most recent viral concept videos and increased demand for programs. Now is the time
 to add staff so that the organization can continue making dreams a reality for youth from the inner-city who do not
 readily have access to the fundamental training to make careers in dance possible.

 CAC defines Organizational Capacity as an organization’s ability to successfully manage resources to their best use
 now and for years to come. 
 1. Describe the board, staff, and/or volunteers that steward your organization. How do you recruit for and
 engage with this group? 
 Board engagement slightly waned during the pandemic; however, the board is now working on engaging and
 growing. Our three active board members are currently working on prospecting and recruiting new members. Our
 goal is to add three new board members by the end of the year and four additional board members in 2023. Board
 members have worked in an advisory capacity and have been avid fundraisers for the organization. In addition, our
 booster club, a group of active parents, supports the organization's fundraising efforts and events.
 2. Describe your organizational planning process for the current year. How do you know that you are on track?
 Who is key to this process, both within your organization and outside it? 
 We have a three-year strategic plan that outlines our goals and objectives for the next three years. Every program
 we conduct must align with at least one of the areas of our strategy. Alignment with the strategic plan keeps us
 focused and on track. Our Executive Director, Board of Directors, and Instructors all play a part in ensuring that we
 maintain our alignment with the strategic plan. Furthermore, our strategic plan informs the types of organizations
 we partner with outside the organization.

3. Describe your organization’s current financial situation. How does your organization plan strategically to
 achieve and maintain a strong financial position? Who set your organization’s current fiscal year budget and
 how are they qualified? 
 Buck Out Cleveland’s operating budget is approximately $200,000 per year. The budget has grown as the
 programming has expanded over the years. We rely heavily on outreach contracts and tuition from our in-studio
 dance company to meet our critical budget needs. We also maintain a strong pipeline of local and national funders
 to support our work. We also have a development plan that includes event ticket sales, individual donor
 campaigns, fundraising events, and crowdfunding. Moreover, Buck Out Cleveland will connect with corporate
 sponsors to provide additional support.

Mission statement 
 Refresh Collective is a 501(c)3 nonprofit arts and education agency whose mission is to harness the power of hiphop music and hand-printed apparel to help young people flourish.
 Organizational history 
 Refresh Collective was founded by Dee Jay Doc Harrill in 2011 as the Fresh Camp, a hip-hop-in-action summer
 program which used the recording arts to build new bonds and explore everything fresh about the Cleveland
 community. Since 2011, summer Fresh Camps have expanded into new neighborhoods while school outreach
 programs engage students within the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. Refresh Collective has taught over
 10,000 youth ages 8 to 18 to find their voices through lyric writing, digital music composition, and recording. In
 2019, Refresh Collective established the Fresh Lab, an educational recording studio located in Cleveland’s Detroit
 Shoreway neighborhood to offer out-of-school time programs, workforce development opportunities, and virtual inschool programs --even through the 2020 COVID pandemic.

Describe your project. Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and
 when and where your project takes place. 
 Refresh Collective will run a high-level digital-arts program for innercity teenagers & grow our workforce of digital
 media artists in our 2023 Fresh Force program. 
 Planning efforts largely revolve around partner collaborations. We've developed this mastery-level job training
 program since summer 2021 building meaningful arts education and workforce development around the six-week
 summer jobs program supported by our community partner Youth Opportunities Unlimited. We engage local
 recording artists and industry professionals to line up guest speakers, & we rely on our community partnerships for
 performance & apprenticeship opportunities for Fresh Force participants. 
 Activities: 
 January 2023 - Interviewing & onboarding teen participants begins 
 May-June 2023 - Worksite orientation for fifteen teenagers chosen for the Fresh Force Juneteenth Weekend 2023
 - Our first Fresh Force performance will showcase the music of veteran Fresh Force participants to inspire new
 recruits 
 June 20 - July 28 - The Fresh Force works 25-30 hours a week on payroll during the summer employment period at
 the Fresh Lab Recording Studio. All major instruction & production is completed during this summer intensive.
 August-December - Fall programming provides ongoing performance opportunities and industry connections for
 ongoing education & apprenticeship opportunities. For high school graduates we also help facilitate teacher aide &
 professional development opportunities like a digital music marketing masterclass with iHeartRadio.
 If the Fresh Force is implemented successfully teens will achieve these learning objectives:
 1. Mastery of music production including lyric writing, digital music composition, recording engineering, mixing and
 mastering 
 2. Working knowledge of digital photography, videography & graphic design 
 4. Adept job-readiness skills and an understanding of digital media career paths
 5. High level interpersonal communication skills to work in a team toward creative ends.

Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?
 Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to
 demonstrate your project’s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by
 understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. 
 The Refresh Collective community includes all young people of the city of Cleveland, especially teenagers that
 attend CMSD schools, youth from black and brown communities, and young people with no other access to arts
 education. The Fresh Force recruits teens from our in-school high school programs at CMSD schools and digital
 media afterschool programs. 
 To prepare teens for the onboarding process we offer free ""My First Job Interview"" workshops before interviewing
 applicants to narrow our list of Fresh Force teens down to fifteen. We then support the fifteen families through the
 complicated process to acquire a Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU) summer job. YOU validates family income to
 meet federal TANIF funding regulations, so each participant in the Fresh Force is from a ""Needy Family"".
 Youth voice drives all creative programming at Refresh Collective programming. When the Fresh Force performs
 they are expressing authentic perspectives from and aspirations for their community.

How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and
 audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?
 The Fresh Force program is built around the Refresh Collective Core Values of Active Mentorship & Synergistic
 Service. 
 Active mentorship involves meeting teenagers where they are at & engaging them with culturally relevant hip-hop
 curriculum to grab their attention. From there we help students prepare for the professional experience. Often times
 the Fresh Force is the youth's first job, so Refresh Collective works to support them & their families through the
 entire process. 
 Synergistic Service means we build long term working relationships with schools, community centers & other
 community leaders to enhance our programming and strengthen the Cleveland community. Arts agencies,
 independent artists & other hip-hop industry stakeholders are invited in to share their unique experience with the
 Fresh Force participants. Our goal is to prepare these teenagers to be the future workforce, so building this digitalarts network has real economic development outcomes for the community.
 Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy 
 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.
 Fresh Force in-take interviews are used to identify each teenager's strengths & goals for growth. Teens are
 assigned to small groups to work with throughout the summer. From June 20 - July 28 small groups produce
 original hip-hop music, music videos, album art & custom apparel working collaboratively to meet a challenging set
 of deadlines. The Fresh Force teens themselves craft the message, vision & execution of these projects.
 Refresh staff deliver stair-step instruction building each small group up for each next step in the production
 process. Industry guests visit for Q&A's with the teens offering career advice & networking opportunities. The
 summer culminates with a performance at a local jazz venue where the young artists take the stage to perform their
 brand new music for the world. 
 Each participant is prepared to continue their own career pursuits & collaborations at the end of the Summer. HipHop and digital media projects spiral out even after the Fresh Force concludes.

Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an
 outside panelist reviewing your application? 
 Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone
 who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,
 historical context., etc. 
 Refresh Collective was founded as the Fresh Camp, a hip-hop in action summer camp that our Founder, David
 ""DeeJay Doc"" Harrill started in his living room at his home in the Glenville Neighborhood of Cleveland.
 Refresh Collective has delivered in-school arts-enrichment to every freshman class of MC2 STEM Cleveland
 Metropolitan School District (CMSD) High School since 2011. Each class composes, writes & records their own
 original hip hop track. 
 In 2019 Refresh Collective moved to its current space in the Detroit Shoreway neighborhood of Cleveland. This
 storefront & educational recording studio is known as the Fresh Lab. Complete with a computer lab & 3 recording
 booths, the Fresh Lab can work with up to 20 young people at one time. 
 The Fresh Force allows us to build the culture of Refresh Collective by building up teen participants toward mastery
 of the digital arts. Our hope is that the Fresh Force participants will continue to work with us after graduation as
 instructors & guest artists. 
 Our Fresh Force allows teens to work for part-time wages through YOU Summer Youth Employment Program. CAC
 funds will allow us to offer stipends to 1-3 deserving students who cannot make it through the YOU onboarding
 process. We are working to arrange internships & apprenticeships with local industry professionals for deserving
 Fresh Force participants each Fall. The Fresh Force is an exciting workforce development & career exposure
 opportunity for innercity Cleveland youth.

 NO CAC Funds will be used for the line item above named ""Overhead Costs and Groceries for Lunches""
 CAC Funds WILL be used as follows: 
 $10,000 Instructor Wages 
 $5000 Youth Stipends for deserving teens who could not complete YOU onboarding
 $1000 Honorariums for Guest instructors 
 $2500 Fees for professional development like digital music marketing w/ iHeart Media

 2. How will you proceed with your project if your project doesn’t receive the full amount of funding requested
 from CAC? 
 Tip: Most applicants to Project Support receive a portion of the funds they request based on their score. CAC does
 not expect any organization to carry out their full project on only a partial budget.
 Refresh Collective solicit donations from our donor base year round. We regularly build relationships with local
 foundation & we would hope to be able to raise the $20,000 else where. 
 Without full funding we would need to reduce our instructional staff and the fall season professional development
 and apprenticeship opportunities for the Fresh Force youth. 
 Lastly we may need to reduce the Fresh Force numbers down from 15 if we are unable to fundraise for the full
 budget.

Mission statement 
 Baldwin Wallace University is an academic community committed to the liberal arts and sciences as the foundation
 for lifelong learning. The University fulfills this mission through excellence in teaching and learning within a
 challenging, supportive environment that enhances students' intellectual and spiritual growth. BW Community Arts
 School Mission: To enrich lives by providing experiences that promote life-long engagement with the arts.
 Organizational history 
 The Baldwin Wallace University Conservatory of Music, founded in 1899 by organist and Bach scholar Albert
 Riemenschneider, offers a long tradition of musical excellence to our campus and the larger community. Today,
 more than 300 undergraduate students study at the Conservatory under the tutelage of faculty members of The
 Cleveland Orchestra, respected conductors, theorists, historians, and educators. As a part of a key strategy in
 supporting our greater community, the Conservatory Outreach Department was founded in 1976 as a divisional
 school of the University. Founded as a community music school, its main focus was to offer Dalcroze classes and
 music lessons for younger children. Through compelling market research and as a strategic priority to the university,
 the division was expanded in 2019 to become the Community Arts School. The program portfolio was expanded to
 include dance, music, theater, and visual art classes for students of any age and ability.

 1. Describe your project. Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and
 when and where your project takes place. 
 For over 46 years, the Baldwin Wallace Community Arts School (CAS) has been a center for summer arts
 programming. We are excited to continue the successful summer programming for all of our students. Overnight
 offerings for students in grades 4-9 include: String, Piano, Choral, Band, and Music Theatre Camp, and Dance
 Immersion. Each program includes a full day schedule: group rehearsals, sectionals, classes, social, and
 recreational activities. Exemplary local, regional, and national educators and teaching artists play a crucial role in
 leading the curriculum. Day classes for students in grades 4-9 include dance offerings in multiple styles, Dalcroze
 Eurhythmics, Printmaking, and Contemporary & Modern Art. For high school students (grades 9-12), we offer the
 Conservatory Summer Institute (CSI), a comprehensive program designed for musicians considering careers in the
 arts. CSI curriculum includes private lessons, chamber and full ensembles, and classes. Students may add tracks
 such as composition, Music Theatre (MT), or an Audition Preparation Program. Composition students have the
 opportunity to write an original piece for performance, and MT students perform a final showcase. CSI faculty
 includes BW Conservatory Faculty and members of The Cleveland Orchestra. Planning for these offerings begins
 immediately following the completion of our summer. Student, parent, and staff feedback is collected through
 anonymous surveys and is our first priority as we make changes for our upcoming year. We also receive invaluable
 feedback from local educators who sent their students to camp. Once these changes are recorded and planned,
 we turn to choosing our camp faculty from a list of esteemed local educators. There are university meetings to
 leverage all facilities and departments to the best of our ability. Additionally, Conservatory staff make regular visits
 to local schools to lead ensemble workshops, endeavoring to engage and recruit young artists for our summer
 programs.

 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?
 Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to
 demonstrate your project’s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by
 understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. 
 The Community Arts School (CAS) community includes any person seeking to engage in the arts. Throughout the
 summer, we engage over 500 students in our summer arts programs, hire over 100 artists, and provide free, public
 concerts to an audience of approximately 1500 community members. Students have access to state-of-the-art
 facilities and technology throughout their time here at CAS. Additionally, 30 pre-service music educators from BW
 and other universities are hired and provide hands-on learning experience as camp counselors. We engage with
 our community at large through school visits, anonymous surveys, and free concerts, masterclasses, and recitals
 throughout the academic year and the summer. School visits help us identify and recruit students who need tuition
 assistance to attend camp. We have listened to concerns and provide residential and commuter options for our
 camps and transportation for our students who receive scholarships to increase accessibility.
 2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and
 audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?
 CAS finds it integral to work with area partners to build and strengthen engagement and accessibility. We nurture
 relationships with funders for tuition assistance and work directly with social service agencies who seek
 opportunities for disadvantaged youth within the community. CAS works to ensure all students feel celebrated and
 reflected in leadership. Camp faculty this year included a diverse range - 33% identified as African-American or
 Black, and at least 25% identified within the LGBTQ+ community. Several counselors shared their non-binary
 identification with students, and all students were provided the opportunity to share their pronouns and identities
 with our staff, if desired. Our registration process includes areas to discuss accommodation necessities and
 designate a student’s comfortability with transgender or non-binary roommates, ensuring the safety of our gender
 diverse students. These efforts, and our dedication to growth, help us maintain strong community relations.

Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.
 Our organization is grateful to be located within Cuyahoga County, where active artists are plentiful and impressive.
 We work to ensure collaboration and learning between our camp participants and local artists each year for new,
 enriching experiences. For example, our middle school conductors bring music from new and underrepresented
 composers and unfamiliar styles to our String and Band campers. A BW Music Theatre graduate and performer
 joined our Music Theatre campers for a masterclass, performance, and Q&A session. She was able to share with
 our students the joys and challenges of her work, nurture their creativity and individuality, and advise those who
 are seeking careers in the arts. Additionally, our dancers in Dance Immersion were exposed to esteemed dance
 educators from the area. These educators brought new styles of dance to the students, including Latin ballroom
 and hip-hop. Dancers left our campus feeling inspired to engage with the arts in areas outside of their norm.
 Organizational Capacity 
 4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.
 Our team is made up of Community Arts School staff, Conservatory faculty, and educators throughout Ohio. Our
 administrative CAS team includes Adam Sheldon, Assistant Provost; Cory Isler-Manzo, Associate Director; Julia
 Morreale, Camp Manager; Heather Dennen, Director of Dance; Those listed transition into a management role
 while students are on campus with us. 
 Baldwin Wallace faculty serving as Summer Arts Programs directors include Dr. David Pope, Chair of Music
 Education; Dr. Andrew Machamer, Professor of Music Education; and Dr. Julian Ross, Chair of the String
 Department and Professor of Violin. 
 Conductors and sectional coaches are comprised of esteemed middle and high school music educators throughout
 Ohio. 
 Please note, it takes many more people to successfully execute our project. We typically find ourselves with a team
 of approximately 100 staff and faculty members throughout the summer, including student counselors, CAS staff,
 and administrative personnel.

Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to
 accomplish within this project? 
 Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and
 equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. 
 Goal Increase our reach to involve 5% more students from
 underrepresented and underfunded communities in our
 Middle School Camps. We know that 23% of our
 students were non-white. While we do not yet have as
 defined a process for collecting gender identity and
 sexual orientation information, we know from the
 students who chose to share their identities that at least
 5% of our middle school students identified as trans or
 non-binary, and there are more students within the
 LGBTQ+ community as a whole. 
 How will you know you have accomplished or made We will know we have made progress toward our goal
 by collecting data from our middle school students
 progress towards your goal? 
 during summer 2023. Data will always be collected
 anonymously, but we hope that our students are willing
 to share their identities with us. We will also know we
 have made progress toward our goal by receiving
 feedback from families and students about their level of
 comfort and safety while under our care at camp. This
 feedback may come personally or through an
 anonymous survey.

Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an
 outside panelist reviewing your application? 
 Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone
 who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,
 historical context., etc. 
 Our area partners are truly the key to bringing this exceptional programming to students in the community. We are
 always grateful for the support that CAC is able to provide to help us share the arts with our youth over the
 summer. Although we paused our field trips to mitigate COVID-19 spread, we are hopeful and excited to bring our
 students back into the community for Cleveland Orchestra concerts, Playhouse Square performances, and more in
 2023. As part of a new equity initiative, an anonymous survey was provided to camp families asking for school
 district and racial identity information. Through this survey, we learned that our students come from 57 districts, and
 23% of students identify as non-white. According to the Ohio census, this reflects a higher rate of racial diversity
 than the state of Ohio. Equipped with this information, we can set tangible goals to increase our reach in
 underrepresented communities. Additionally, we are working on gradual pay increases, especially for our student
 counselors, to raise weekly pay by $150 within 2 years. We added new support systems and policies to protect our
 LGBTQ+ students and our students of color, such as methods for reporting discrimination and ensuring safe
 roommates. In our 2022 survey, a parent told us about their student: “they liked being called their preferred name.
 They felt respected and safe.” Although we are not done improving, we are glad to know that the students we are
 reaching feel comfortable with us.

 CAC funds support critical areas including: administrative personnel, artistic personnel, and production/event
 expenses. Of these areas, the majority of this funding will assist in hiring our artistic personnel (employees and
 contractors) who serve on the Summer Arts Program staff. As noted, this includes over 100 Cuyahoga County
 artists. These professionals are a key driver in delivering exception experiences to program participants.

How will you proceed with your project if your project doesn’t receive the full amount of funding requested
 from CAC? 
 Tip: Most applicants to Project Support receive a portion of the funds they request based on their score. CAC does
 not expect any organization to carry out their full project on only a partial budget.
 If we do not receive the full amount of funding requested, we will need to limit the enrollment of our programs. As
 we are dedicated to ensuring one-on-one instruction, a smaller amount of funds available for exceptional
 professionals would have to result in a smaller amount of student numbers. In addition, we will be unable to fund
 our 2023 field trips to vibrant displays of art in the community, such as Cleveland Orchestra concerts and
 Playhouse Square performances.

Mission statement 
 Work with youth to challenge stereotypes through writing, filmmaking and art. 
 Organizational history 
 Stephanie Lassiter, Cleveland native, was the National Director of Education for Scenarios USA a nonprofit, where
 she implemented the national and local education program for 9 years. Stephanie supported and inspired
 Cleveland youth to realize their full potential through the power of education, media, and storytelling. Over 15,000
 Cleveland youth were served 1,100 educators trained in 5 curricula, 10 winning stories written by youth- made into
 films and screened locally and The Showtime Channel. When Scenarios USA ceased operations in 2017
 Clevelanders requested to continue to address the need. A funders group was formed and Stephanie, expanded
 the work by deepening the impact in Cleveland. The annual ""What is Power & Community?"" Story to Film Contest
 asks Cleveland youth in 6th-12 grade to write a story that identifies and solves a problem that impacts their
 community and health. The winning story is made into a movie with local filmmakers, their school and neighborhood
 community.

 Storytelling through animation & filmmaking 
 2. Project Summary 
 Briefly describe the project in a sentence or two. 
 We work with Cleveland youth in 6th-12th grade through storytelling, visual arts and media literacy to help them to
 identify who they are and who they want to be in their community. Students identify a problem in their community
 and write a short story or a short film on how to solve it through community engagement, beautification and
 building relationships. They are mentored by artist and film professionals. The winning story is made into a film with
 the youth storyteller and local community.

 End Date (mm/dd/yyyy) 11/30/2023 
 6. Public Event Location(s) Where will the events posted on ClevelandArtsEvents.com be hosted?
 The story will be filmed in the neighborhood of the winning Cleveland writer. We will work with the local film school,
 casting director, actors and film professionals to create this film. In addition, we will engage local community leaders
 who are connected to the topic of the short film to raise awareness and create a study guide to accompany the
 film. In the past we premiered the winning story to film during the Cleveland International Film Festival(CIFF).
 7. Total number of expected participants and/or audience members 
 8. Will the event/activity be free or fee-based? How was this decision made? 
 The story to film storytelling program is free for participants. This decision has been made because we serve youth
 who are living at or below the poverty level in Cleveland schools. We understand that this opportunity of
 mentorship, training and career development has a cost but it is also a unique opportunity for our youth to work
 with local and national film professionals. Our goal is to continue to seek funding support to make the annual
 storytelling program free for youth and families.

 1. Describe your project. Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and
 when and where your project takes place. 
 The annual ""What is Power & Community?"" Story to Film Contest is for Cleveland youth in 6th-12 grade. We ask
 youth to identify who they are and who they want to be in their community through creatively writing a story that
 identifies and solves a problem that impacts their community, safety, family or friends. Cleveland youth creatively
 write stories with unique outcomes that explores topics critical to them such as teen relationships, bullying, drug
 use, gun violence, immigration, mental illness and identity. In the fall of 2021 over 100 Cleveland teachers will
 attend our What is Power and Community 
 professional development curriculum workshop. Teachers use these lessons to help youth critical think about the
 challenges that prevent them for living longer and safer lives. In December 2022, youth submit their 1-5 page story
 to our contest. Our 50 member selection committee of community volunteers read and rate stories and the winning
 story is selected to be made into a film in the Fall of 2023. All youth who submitted their stories will be invited to be
 interns on the 50 member film set and have the opportunity to be mentored by film professionals to help make the
 film. They will also work with the local 
 film school to make the film's behind the scenes. During Spring of 2023, the winning writer will work with an
 accomplished film director and writer to expand their short story into a 15 page shooting script. They will also work
 with the Cleveland coalition who are community leaders selected because they are most connected to the themes
 explored in the story. The Cleveland coalition will provide advice and insight for the characters and story. The
 preproduction of the film and behind the scenes film will take place in Spring of 2023 and production will happen in
 the Fall of 2023. In partnership with the Cleveland community and Cleveland Metropolitan School District the film
 will be produced in the community of the winning writer.

 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?
 Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to
 demonstrate your project’s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by
 understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. 
 We serve youth, grades 4-12 throughout the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. Students who participate in
 our program reflect the diversity of this region. Census data from students’ zip codes indicate the majority came
 from neighborhoods where the median income is under $30,000; 11% of residents are college graduates. 53% of
 family households are led by single parents; 18% of neighborhood housing units are vacant. According to the
 2015 Census, more than half of all people under 18 in Greater Cleveland live in poverty. During the preproduction
 and production stage we communicate frequently with the team of community, school and Cleveland coalition of
 volunteers who are experienced in the topics of the story to carry out the project. They also help recruit actors,
 crew members and provide locations for the production. We also meet with the writer's teacher, parents and school
 leaders to ensure everyone is involved in the process. 
 2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and
 audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?
 All youth, especially in BIPOC communities are growing up in a society in which inequity is all too real and the
 extraordinary, including extreme levels of oppression, is becoming all too ordinary. Youth at the margins of society
 are often reduced to statistics based on zip code and are commonly defined by dominant cultural narratives that
 don’t reflect their reality. Art of Me elevates their narratives, which are often silenced or overlooked, making them
 part of local and national dialogue. The Cleveland coalition, winning writer and teacher of the winning writer will
 work with Art of Me staff to create lessons and a study guide for viewers to use to better navigate the challenges
 explored in the film. The film will also be 
 shown at film festivals and online for classroom use. The film will be used as a tool and beacon of light to present a
 new idea to the world of What Power and Community is and to inspire others to think creatively to solve issues
 impacting our community.

 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.
 Youth have the answers to improve our present and future. Our work creates opportunities for these answers to
 shared through their authentic voice with the support of the local community. Our story to film program isn't focused
 on the best writer but the best story that challenges social norms while giving creative insight on how we can solve
 issues most impacting our young people, specifically BIPOC. Recent research states that youth in Cleveland have
 the highest rates of depression and suicide along with feelings of isolation, hopelessness and neglect. Our project
 challenges these social norms to inspire youth to write the future they would like to see in their community. The
 power of storytelling and filmmaking creates a living visual for others to see the steps on how they can also
 catalyze change. We also train our youth in public speaking while creating platforms for their stories to be seen at
 local film festivals, churches, schools and through our online streaming platforms.
 Organizational Capacity 
 4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.
 Our leadership team for this project includes Art of Me staff and many community partners including Cleveland

 Tip: Most applicants to Project Support receive a portion of the funds they request based on their score. CAC does
 not expect any organization to carry out their full project on only a partial budget.
 If we don't receive the full amount we would have to combine roles of staff and contractors to provide the services

 answers What is Power & Community?, and making it ready for distribution for the world is our priority. We will also
 seek more funding opportunities and donations.

 Please tell us in 1500 characters (approx 250 words) how this request impacts our mission of : Helping underserved individuals move toward self-sufficiency.
 BGCNEO provides youth with safe, welcoming spaces to participate in unique programs and once-in-alifetime experiences. Members form strong relationships, eat nutritious meals, and build confidence and
 character. Clubs offer opportunities that many youth may otherwise never have, helping bridge the gap for
 kids experiencing poverty and disinvestment in their schools and communities. Through age-appropriate
 curriculum, youth work to build progressive pathways towards high school graduation and beyond. All
 BGCNEO programs fall under the pillars of academics, health & wellness, and character & leadership, but the
 real fun lies in the details. Members participate in activities ranging from sports leagues to musical
 instruments, to practicing yoga and meditation, creating podcasts, skiing, and snowboarding, cultivating a
 garden, cooking, working as Junior Staff, participating in career cohorts with the Cleveland Guardians or
 Hyland Software, or traveling on an out of state college exposure trip. These are just a small assortment of
 the many opportunities that await each youth that walks through the doors of a BGCNEO Club. Regardless of
 challenging life circumstances, regularly attending youth demonstrate improved academic performance,
 strong peer & mentor relationships, and a substantial awareness of the impact of good decision-making. They
 are curious, talented, ambitious, and kind, and work hard daily to overcome limitations and strive to reach
 their greatest potential.

 She says the pandemic taught her a few things. 
 “I felt it helped me learn about myself,” she says. “I’m not a very social person, but
 I found out I really missed being around my friends on the track team and at the
 Club. It felt so good to see them again.” 
 Abrianna captured the Boys & Girls Clubs state Youth of the Year title in early 2021.
 She says winning the honor has been a goal since her freshman year. “I feel so good
 and so blessed,” she says. 
 Abrianna, who lives in Akron, says she will always treasure this time in her life.
 ABRIANNA JOHNSON, 17 “I feel that without the Club, I would not be the person I am today,” she says.
 “Even though time goes on and I will get older, I have every intention of giving back

 First, his school closed. Two months later, his mom died unexpectedly. He then 
 spent a grief-filled summer living “from couch to couch” as the family struggled 
 to make ends meet. Distracted and distraught, he did not embrace the online 
 learning that greeted him in the fall. 
 Nathaniel Rush thought about giving up. 
 But he didn’t. Lifted up by friends, family members and his Boys & Girls Club 
 director, Joseph Greathouse, Nathaniel, 18, went to work. He studied harder in 
 school, took advice more seriously and used daily pickup basketball games at his 
 Cleveland Club as “my relief from stress.”

 “My grades,” Floyd says with a smile, “went up like crazy.” 
 The double dose of Club help and the return of in-school classes were a relief to
 Floyd and his aunt, with whom he lives. She is a former nurse who can no longer
 work due to a disability. 
 When he first joined the Boys & Girls Club, Floyd was, by all accounts, an angry
 kid. Staff members showed him techniques by which he could control his anger
 and have more fun. Today, he is a walking, talking advertisement for the Club and
 its ability to transform young lives. 
 “I feel like I’ve become a better person,” Floyd says. “I rarely get mad, and I am a

 There are other times she would rather forget. 
 In sixth grade, she missed four months of school following reconstructive surgery to straighten her 
 right foot. “I knew virtual (learning) before there was virtual,” she jokes. And she often found herself 
 getting picked on when she first moved to Sandusky from Bellevue. 
 Joining the Boys & Girls Club was a turning point. “I absolutely fell in love with the Club,” she says. 
 “It is safe, homey and relaxing. If I needed someone, they were there. They make you a better person.” 
 Today, a confident, smiling Jayde is an honor student with goals – and a lot of friends cheering her on.
