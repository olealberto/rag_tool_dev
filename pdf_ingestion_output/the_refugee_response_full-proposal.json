It is important that you communicate all relevant information\n necessary for a person unfamiliar with your organization to fully understand your project.

Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and\n when and where your project takes place. \n In March of 2022 The Refugee Response (TRR) moved our programming and office staff to a new headquarters\n and significantly expanded our space and facilities. We now have expanded space for art-making, education, and\n recreation for all of our clients -- many of whom are children and teens. Art is a central part of our programming\n here, and we are seeking new ways to activate our spaces with permanent art installations and art-making\n activities. Engaging refugee communities who struggle with mental health challenges related to their resettlement\n with art is a proven and powerful tool decreasing anxiety and feelings of anger and depression.\n As part of a the long-term relationships and support structures we build for and with our refugee clients of all ages\n we seek out opportunities to partner with Cleveland-based artists, and artisans, who have had a similar life\n experience. Cleveland-based, Iraqi-born Muslim visual artist Kubra Abbas Alhilali is a remarkable and successful\n artist who understands the unique experience of being a refugee. This project brings Abbas Alhilali to TRR to work\n closely with our youth clients to create new artwork in a series of 4 interactive workshops that will expand our\n clients' exposure to new forms and ways of making art, as well as connect them to a positive role model in the\n Cleveland community. \n Further, this program will culminate in a public event and celebration with music, poetry, culturally specific food, and\n the exhibition of the artwork made in the workshops by our youth clients, as well as a celebration and unveiling of a\n new mural painted by Abbas Alhilali in TRR's new headquarters, building a permanent reminder and presence for\n art in our shared space. \n 5 / 14\n\nPublic Benefit \n 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n TRR serves people who have entered the US through the national refugee resettlement program or on\n humanitarian parole visas. TRR's educational programs serve refugee students in 4-12 grade in the Cleveland\n area, including Cleveland Metropolitan School District, Cleveland Heights, Lakewood and Parma. TRR is committed\n to placing the will of the communities we serve at the center of our decision-making processes. From the founding\n of our organization, core staff members were members of the refugee community. Today, roughly 50% of our staff\n comes from the refugee community. \n Creative expression is a powerful vehicle for growth and we deliberately make space to support our youth clients in\n this area to build a richer community. This program and event will engage our youth clients, their families, and\n extended communities by bringing them together to celebrate Abbas Alhilali's work and the importance of art as a\n vehicle for interpersonal, emotional, and professional development. \n 6 / 14\n\n2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n TRR\u2019s youth programs are based on authentic engagement and building personal relationships between staff,\n mentors; often guiding youth through some of life\u2019s big decisions. Most refugees who enter through the\n resettlement program were displaced from their homes by war or persecution and have spent years living in\n refugee camps. According to the WHO, refugees are 10 times as likely as non-refugees to exhibit symptoms of\n post-traumatic stress disorder. \n TRR has a number of art centric programs that demonstrate that many young refugees enjoy art and are excited to\n participate in art activities. Expression through art has been found to help refugees express and process the\n traumatic events of their past, and the stressful conditions of day-to-day life. Further, refugee teens and children\n who participate in the after-school classes will have the opportunity to learn from an artist who has been through\n similar experiences, and create art in a safe and empathetic environment of their peers.\n Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n Both the workshops and the mural will be developed in coordinating with the featured artist, Kubra Abbas Alhilali.\n We will work closely with her to design a mural that is welcoming, inspiring, and that acts as a touchstone of the\n importance and possibilities of art for our community and youth clients. By connecting potential young artists early\n in their educational journey and lives with an established refugee artist, we hope to inspire them to imagine a\n broad set of possibilities for their lives, to encourage self-soothing and productive behaviors such as art making,\n and we also hope to create a mentorship pipeline for future generations of refugee artists in Cleveland. As we\n connect Abbas Alhilali directly to our youth refugee clients we are creating a link to the art world here in Cleveland\n that offers an expanded set of potential relationships and institutions to seek out and explore.\n Organizational Capacity \n 7 / 14\n\n4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.\n The project is being led by Kubra Abbas Alhilali and TRR staff, Naila Paul, the Director of Youth Programs and\n Kate Nickley, Youth Mentoring Program Manager. \n Kubra Abbas Alhilali is an Iraq-born Muslim artist and educator who arrived in the US as a refugee, she lives and\n works in Cleveland. She attended Amman\u2019s Fine Arts Institute in Jordan and has exhibited her work in solo and\n group exhibitions. She is currently producing a number of murals and public art projects in the Cleveland area.\n Naila Paul is an educator and program leader. She directs the organization\u2019s youth focused programming teams,\n including Teen Response and the K-8 Youth Mentoring Program, serving the educational needs of resettled\n refugee youth and families. \n Kate Nickley works alongside the Youth Mentoring Program team to coordinate program services. She also\n organizes TRR's Community Advisory meetings and her professional background is in informal education, family\n programming and horticulture. \n 4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to\n accomplish within this project? \n Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and\n equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. \n Goal Our aim with this project is to bring an established\n refugee artist to TRR to work closely with our Youth\n Mentoring clients, offering them a rich and high impact\n experience making and thinking about art while seeing\n a change-maker in our community create a lasting\n impact -- interpersonally, and with the installation of the\n wall mural. \n How will you know you have accomplished or made When the wall mural is completed we will be able to see\n and feel the impact of the artist's work on a daily basis.\n progress towards your goal? \n We are building a home base for our client's and staff at\n our office and headquarters, and the mural is a visual\n manifestation of how important art and culture is to our\n work across all of our youth programs. \n 8 / 14\n\n5. Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an\n outside panelist reviewing your application? \n Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone\n who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,\n historical context., etc. \n The activities and initiatives of the The Refugee Response (TRR) are broad in their scope but focused in their aims.\n As stated previously in the application we work to empower resettled families to grow roots, supporting them in\n becoming engaged, self-sufficient and contributing members of their new communities.\n TRR is a Cleveland based 510c3 founded in 2010 which operates 9 unique programs for individuals and families\n resettled through the national refugee resettlement program. In 2022 TRR will provide services to over 700\n individuals from over 12 different nationalities or ethnic identities speaking upwards of 20 languages and dialects.\n While TRR works with children and adults, in the past two years TRR has seen the biggest demand as well as the\n biggest growth in services directed towards teens and young adults. \n A big part of what we do happens at the Ohio City Farm (OCF), a six-acre urban farm located in the heart of\n Cleveland, OH. Founded in 2010, the farm is a self-sustaining social enterprise run by TRR. The farm employs\n newcomers at an hourly rate significantly above average farm wages in the state. OCF has become a robust and\n resilient business through small-scale organic farming and a diversified means of sales including a 450-member\n Community Supported Agriculture Program. \n What we do, at the core, is provide highly personalized services to our clients to help facilitate their resettlement.\n Our successes are our clients' successes. \n Project Budget and Financials Form - PS 2023 \n Completed - Aug 3 2022 \n Project Budget and Financials Form - 2023 PS \n 9 / 14\n\nComplete the following project budget tables. \n Income \n Please describe your sources of income and their amounts in the table below.

How will you spend CAC funds? \n Tip: Indicate how CAC funds will be used.

This\n funding will support the artist directly as well as our community engagement. \n 11 / 14\n\n2. How will you proceed with your project if your project doesn\u2019t receive the full amount of funding requested\n from CAC? \n Tip: Most applicants to Project Support receive a portion of the funds they request based on their score. CAC does\n not expect any organization to carry out their full project on only a partial budget.\n We have already secured funding for a portion of the program and we will proceed without producing the mural if\n we do not receive CAC funding. We would also scale back the community engagement program in order to make\n sure the four workshops were fully funded. \n Upload your SMU| DataArts Funder Report - PS \n Incomplete \n For organizations whose maximum grant amount is $5,000 this section is optional.\n Required for organizations requesting more than $5,000.

Today, roughly 50% of our staff\n comes from the refugee community. \n Creative expression is a powerful vehicle for growth and we deliberately make space to support our youth clients in\n this area to build a richer community. This program and event will engage our youth clients, their families, and\n extended communities by bringing them together to celebrate Abbas Alhilali's work and the importance of art as a\n vehicle for interpersonal, emotional, and professional development. \n 6 / 14\n\n2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n TRR\u2019s youth programs are based on authentic engagement and building personal relationships between staff,\n mentors; often guiding youth through some of life\u2019s big decisions. Most refugees who enter through the\n resettlement program were displaced from their homes by war or persecution and have spent years living in\n refugee camps. According to the WHO, refugees are 10 times as likely as non-refugees to exhibit symptoms of\n post-traumatic stress disorder. \n TRR has a number of art centric programs that demonstrate that many young refugees enjoy art and are excited to\n participate in art activities. Expression through art has been found to help refugees express and process the\n traumatic events of their past, and the stressful conditions of day-to-day life. Further, refugee teens and children\n who participate in the after-school classes will have the opportunity to learn from an artist who has been through\n similar experiences, and create art in a safe and empathetic environment of their peers.\n Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n Both the workshops and the mural will be developed in coordinating with the featured artist, Kubra Abbas Alhilali.\n We will work closely with her to design a mural that is welcoming, inspiring, and that acts as a touchstone of the\n importance and possibilities of art for our community and youth clients. By connecting potential young artists early\n in their educational journey and lives with an established refugee artist, we hope to inspire them to imagine a\n broad set of possibilities for their lives, to encourage self-soothing and productive behaviors such as art making,\n and we also hope to create a mentorship pipeline for future generations of refugee artists in Cleveland. As we\n connect Abbas Alhilali directly to our youth refugee clients we are creating a link to the art world here in Cleveland\n that offers an expanded set of potential relationships and institutions to seek out and explore.\n Organizational Capacity \n 7 / 14\n\n4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.\n The project is being led by Kubra Abbas Alhilali and TRR staff, Naila Paul, the Director of Youth Programs and\n Kate Nickley, Youth Mentoring Program Manager. \n Kubra Abbas Alhilali is an Iraq-born Muslim artist and educator who arrived in the US as a refugee, she lives and\n works in Cleveland. She attended Amman\u2019s Fine Arts Institute in Jordan and has exhibited her work in solo and\n group exhibitions. She is currently producing a number of murals and public art projects in the Cleveland area.\n Naila Paul is an educator and program leader. She directs the organization\u2019s youth focused programming teams,\n including Teen Response and the K-8 Youth Mentoring Program, serving the educational needs of resettled\n refugee youth and families. \n Kate Nickley works alongside the Youth Mentoring Program team to coordinate program services. She also\n organizes TRR's Community Advisory meetings and her professional background is in informal education, family\n programming and horticulture. \n 4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to\n accomplish within this project? \n Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and\n equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. \n Goal Our aim with this project is to bring an established\n refugee artist to TRR to work closely with our Youth\n Mentoring clients, offering them a rich and high impact\n experience making and thinking about art while seeing\n a change-maker in our community create a lasting\n impact -- interpersonally, and with the installation of the\n wall mural. \n How will you know you have accomplished or made When the wall mural is completed we will be able to see\n and feel the impact of the artist's work on a daily basis.\n progress towards your goal? \n We are building a home base for our client's and staff at\n our office and headquarters, and the mural is a visual\n manifestation of how important art and culture is to our\n work across all of our youth programs. \n 8 / 14\n\n5. Optional: Is there any additional information about your project or organization that may be helpful to an\n outside panelist reviewing your application? \n Tip: CAC recruits panelists from outside of the region. What might be important information to share with someone\n who is unfamiliar with Cuyahoga County or your work? i.e. demographic information, project location descriptions,\n historical context., etc. \n The activities and initiatives of the The Refugee Response (TRR) are broad in their scope but focused in their aims.\n As stated previously in the application we work to empower resettled families to grow roots, supporting them in\n becoming engaged, self-sufficient and contributing members of their new communities.\n TRR is a Cleveland based 510c3 founded in 2010 which operates 9 unique programs for individuals and families\n resettled through the national refugee resettlement program. In 2022 TRR will provide services to over 700\n individuals from over 12 different nationalities or ethnic identities speaking upwards of 20 languages and dialects.\n While TRR works with children and adults, in the past two years TRR has seen the biggest demand as well as the\n biggest growth in services directed towards teens and young adults. \n A big part of what we do happens at the Ohio City Farm (OCF), a six-acre urban farm located in the heart of\n Cleveland, OH. Founded in 2010, the farm is a self-sustaining social enterprise run by TRR. The farm employs\n newcomers at an hourly rate significantly above average farm wages in the state. OCF has become a robust and\n resilient business through small-scale organic farming and a diversified means of sales including a 450-member\n Community Supported Agriculture Program. \n What we do, at the core, is provide highly personalized services to our clients to help facilitate their resettlement.\n Our successes are our clients' successes. \n Project Budget and Financials Form - PS 2023 \n Completed - Aug 3 2022 \n Project Budget and Financials Form - 2023 PS \n 9 / 14\n\nComplete the following project budget tables. \n Income \n Please describe your sources of income and their amounts in the table below.

Include an overview of planning process, project activities, implementation and\n when and where your project takes place. \n In March of 2022 The Refugee Response (TRR) moved our programming and office staff to a new headquarters\n and significantly expanded our space and facilities. We now have expanded space for art-making, education, and\n recreation for all of our clients -- many of whom are children and teens. Art is a central part of our programming\n here, and we are seeking new ways to activate our spaces with permanent art installations and art-making\n activities. Engaging refugee communities who struggle with mental health challenges related to their resettlement\n with art is a proven and powerful tool decreasing anxiety and feelings of anger and depression.\n As part of a the long-term relationships and support structures we build for and with our refugee clients of all ages\n we seek out opportunities to partner with Cleveland-based artists, and artisans, who have had a similar life\n experience. Cleveland-based, Iraqi-born Muslim visual artist Kubra Abbas Alhilali is a remarkable and successful\n artist who understands the unique experience of being a refugee. This project brings Abbas Alhilali to TRR to work\n closely with our youth clients to create new artwork in a series of 4 interactive workshops that will expand our\n clients' exposure to new forms and ways of making art, as well as connect them to a positive role model in the\n Cleveland community. \n Further, this program will culminate in a public event and celebration with music, poetry, culturally specific food, and\n the exhibition of the artwork made in the workshops by our youth clients, as well as a celebration and unveiling of a\n new mural painted by Abbas Alhilali in TRR's new headquarters, building a permanent reminder and presence for\n art in our shared space. \n 5 / 14\n\nPublic Benefit \n 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n TRR serves people who have entered the US through the national refugee resettlement program or on\n humanitarian parole visas. TRR's educational programs serve refugee students in 4-12 grade in the Cleveland\n area, including Cleveland Metropolitan School District, Cleveland Heights, Lakewood and Parma. TRR is committed\n to placing the will of the communities we serve at the center of our decision-making processes. From the founding\n of our organization, core staff members were members of the refugee community. Today, roughly 50% of our staff\n comes from the refugee community. \n Creative expression is a powerful vehicle for growth and we deliberately make space to support our youth clients in\n this area to build a richer community. This program and event will engage our youth clients, their families, and\n extended communities by bringing them together to celebrate Abbas Alhilali's work and the importance of art as a\n vehicle for interpersonal, emotional, and professional development. \n 6 / 14\n\n2b.
