When the \n pandemic temporarily closed our doors, you helped reopen them with your \n generosity. When our young people \u2013 many caught in the digital divide \u2013 \n learned they could go to our Clubs during the school day to get in-person \n OF NORTHEAST OHIO \n and tech help, they took advantage of the opportunity. \n I hope you will read the inspiring stories in this publication.

Just ask Abrianna Johnson.\n Abrianna, 18, an honor student at Akron\u2019s Archbishop Hoban High School and the\n reigning Ohio Boys & Girls Clubs Youth of the Year, did not take to online learning\n \u201cI felt \n as well as she had hoped. \n (the pandemic) \u201cI am a hands-on person, and at times I just could not understand,\u201d she says.\n \u201cThe reality was I had to find a new way to learn.\u201d For Abrianna, that meant\n reading, searching for online videos to explain specific lesson in classes like physics\n helped me learn \n and getting help from Club staffers. \n The plan worked for Abrianna, who plans to study computer science at the \n about myself.\u201d \n University of Akron. \n She says the pandemic taught her a few things. \n \u201cI felt it helped me learn about myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a very social person, but\n I found out I really missed being around my friends on the track team and at the\n Club. It felt so good to see them again.\u201d \n Abrianna captured the Boys & Girls Clubs state Youth of the Year title in early 2021.\n She says winning the honor has been a goal since her freshman year. \u201cI feel so good\n and so blessed,\u201d she says. \n Abrianna, who lives in Akron, says she will always treasure this time in her life.\n ABRIANNA JOHNSON, 17 \u201cI feel that without the Club, I would not be the person I am today,\u201d she says.\n \u201cEven though time goes on and I will get older, I have every intention of giving back\n BGCNEO\u2019s Youth of the Year \n to my Club and my community.\u201d \n 4 5\n\nHe survives and thrives after \n \u2018 \u2019 \n the hardest year of my life \u2019 \n First, his school closed. Two months later, his mom died unexpectedly. He then \n spent a grief-filled summer living \u201cfrom couch to couch\u201d as the family struggled \n to make ends meet. Distracted and distraught, he did not embrace the online \n learning that greeted him in the fall. \n Nathaniel Rush thought about giving up. \n But he didn\u2019t. Lifted up by friends, family members and his Boys & Girls Club \n director, Joseph Greathouse, Nathaniel, 18, went to work. He studied harder in \n school, took advice more seriously and used daily pickup basketball games at his \n Cleveland Club as \u201cmy relief from stress.\u201d \n Today, Nathaniel is a Cleveland Central Catholic High School graduate and has \n \u201cI feel like the \n been accepted into Cleveland State University, where he plans to pursue a liberal \n arts degree with a focus on history. \n hardest year of my \n \u201cI feel like the hardest year of my life was also the most motivating year of my \n life,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned so much. The Club pushes everyone to be better, and \n life was also the most \n that includes me. Everybody wants to be successful, but not everyone is willing \n to put in the work to be successful.\u201d \n motivating year \n Nathaniel is inspired by the memory of his mother, Tiffany McMillon, who died \n from cardiac arrest. He says he knows his mom wanted him to graduate from \n of my life.\u201d \n high school and become a leader. \n NATHANIEL RUSH, 18 \n \u201cI picture her being proud of me as she is looking down,\u201d he says. \n Club member and \n Cleveland Central High School graduate \n JAYLA VANHORN, 18 \n aspiring sports journalist, Club News editor \n and Ohio State University student \n 6 7\n\nTeen gets back on track \n with help from Club school \n Floyd, 13, was struggling and needed help. \n \u201cI feel like \n He had a lot of trouble learning virtually. With his Lorain school temporarily closed\n due to the pandemic, Floyd\u2019s grades and his interest in virtual classes plummeted.\n I\u2019ve become \n He was falling behind. \n Two things helped Floyd get back on track. His Club, BGCNEO\u2019s Desich Family\n a better \n Campus, became a ClubSmart Learning Center, where kids like him could receive\n in-person and tech help with their schoolwork. Then his new school, Southview\n person.\u201d \n High School, opened its doors two days a week. \n \u201cMy grades,\u201d Floyd says with a smile, \u201cwent up like crazy.\u201d \n The double dose of Club help and the return of in-school classes were a relief to\n Floyd and his aunt, with whom he lives. She is a former nurse who can no longer\n work due to a disability. \n When he first joined the Boys & Girls Club, Floyd was, by all accounts, an angry\n kid. Staff members showed him techniques by which he could control his anger\n and have more fun. Today, he is a walking, talking advertisement for the Club and\n its ability to transform young lives. \n \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become a better person,\u201d Floyd says. \u201cI rarely get mad, and I am a\n lot happier. There is a lot to do. I really like the staff members and I get to hang out\n FLOYD, 13 with friends.

And she often found herself \n getting picked on when she first moved to Sandusky from Bellevue. \n Joining the Boys & Girls Club was a turning point. \u201cI absolutely fell in love with the Club,\u201d she says. \n \u201cIt is safe, homey and relaxing. If I needed someone, they were there. They make you a better person.\u201d \n Today, a confident, smiling Jayde is an honor student with goals \u2013 and a lot of friends cheering her on. \n She wants to earn a spot on her high school\u2019s athletic wall of fame.

Members form strong relationships, eat nutritious meals, and build confidence and\n character. Clubs offer opportunities that many youth may otherwise never have, helping bridge the gap for\n kids experiencing poverty and disinvestment in their schools and communities. Through age-appropriate\n curriculum, youth work to build progressive pathways towards high school graduation and beyond. All\n BGCNEO programs fall under the pillars of academics, health & wellness, and character & leadership, but the\n real fun lies in the details. Members participate in activities ranging from sports leagues to musical\n instruments, to practicing yoga and meditation, creating podcasts, skiing, and snowboarding, cultivating a\n garden, cooking, working as Junior Staff, participating in career cohorts with the Cleveland Guardians or\n Hyland Software, or traveling on an out of state college exposure trip. These are just a small assortment of\n the many opportunities that await each youth that walks through the doors of a BGCNEO Club. Regardless of\n challenging life circumstances, regularly attending youth demonstrate improved academic performance,\n strong peer & mentor relationships, and a substantial awareness of the impact of good decision-making. They\n are curious, talented, ambitious, and kind, and work hard daily to overcome limitations and strive to reach\n their greatest potential. \n Project Description* \n For General Operating Support you may give more detail or simply enter GOS (General Operating Support)\n Funding from The Reinberger Foundation would support BGCNEO Cleveland\u2019s general operations and\n programs, aimed at improving academic performance, health and well-being, and character and leadership\n development in youth ages 6-18. \n LOI Amount Requested* \n $60,000.00 \n Total Project Budget \n not required for General Operating Support \n LOI Term of Project \n for multi year requests enter duration in months \n for yearly grants you may leave blank or enter 12 \n Project Budget Upload OPTIONAL \n Budget not required for General Operating Support \n Printed On: 27 March 2023 Education for 2022 3\n\nLiz Lazar Boys and Girls Clubs of Northeast Ohio\n Project Start Date (only if applicable to this request) \n 05/01/2022 \n Project End Date (only if applicable to this request) \n 04/30/2024 \n Primary Focus Area* \n Please select the primary area of this project. \n Schools and programs that serve school age low income populations in and out of school time\n Population Served* \n select if applicable \n K-12 students \n CMSD (Cleveland Metropolitan School District) students) \n If \"other,\" please explain \n Additional Focus Areas \n Please select no more than two additional areas of impact. \n Arts education \n Workforce Development \n File Uploads \n File Upload \n Would you like to share a PDF file?

Just ask Abrianna Johnson.\n Abrianna, 18, an honor student at Akron\u2019s Archbishop Hoban High School and the\n reigning Ohio Boys & Girls Clubs Youth of the Year, did not take to online learning\n \u201cI felt \n as well as she had hoped. \n (the pandemic) \u201cI am a hands-on person, and at times I just could not understand,\u201d she says.\n \u201cThe reality was I had to find a new way to learn.\u201d For Abrianna, that meant\n reading, searching for online videos to explain specific lesson in classes like physics\n helped me learn \n and getting help from Club staffers. \n The plan worked for Abrianna, who plans to study computer science at the \n about myself.\u201d \n University of Akron. \n She says the pandemic taught her a few things. \n \u201cI felt it helped me learn about myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a very social person, but\n I found out I really missed being around my friends on the track team and at the\n Club. It felt so good to see them again.\u201d \n Abrianna captured the Boys & Girls Clubs state Youth of the Year title in early 2021.\n She says winning the honor has been a goal since her freshman year. \u201cI feel so good\n and so blessed,\u201d she says. \n Abrianna, who lives in Akron, says she will always treasure this time in her life.\n ABRIANNA JOHNSON, 17 \u201cI feel that without the Club, I would not be the person I am today,\u201d she says.\n \u201cEven though time goes on and I will get older, I have every intention of giving back\n BGCNEO\u2019s Youth of the Year \n to my Club and my community.\u201d \n 4 5\n\nHe survives and thrives after \n \u2018 \u2019 \n the hardest year of my life \u2019 \n First, his school closed. Two months later, his mom died unexpectedly. He then \n spent a grief-filled summer living \u201cfrom couch to couch\u201d as the family struggled \n to make ends meet. Distracted and distraught, he did not embrace the online \n learning that greeted him in the fall. \n Nathaniel Rush thought about giving up. \n But he didn\u2019t. Lifted up by friends, family members and his Boys & Girls Club \n director, Joseph Greathouse, Nathaniel, 18, went to work. He studied harder in \n school, took advice more seriously and used daily pickup basketball games at his \n Cleveland Club as \u201cmy relief from stress.\u201d \n Today, Nathaniel is a Cleveland Central Catholic High School graduate and has \n \u201cI feel like the \n been accepted into Cleveland State University, where he plans to pursue a liberal \n arts degree with a focus on history. \n hardest year of my \n \u201cI feel like the hardest year of my life was also the most motivating year of my \n life,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned so much.

Everybody wants to be successful, but not everyone is willing \n to put in the work to be successful.\u201d \n motivating year \n Nathaniel is inspired by the memory of his mother, Tiffany McMillon, who died \n from cardiac arrest. He says he knows his mom wanted him to graduate from \n of my life.\u201d \n high school and become a leader. \n NATHANIEL RUSH, 18 \n \u201cI picture her being proud of me as she is looking down,\u201d he says. \n Club member and \n Cleveland Central High School graduate \n JAYLA VANHORN, 18 \n aspiring sports journalist, Club News editor \n and Ohio State University student \n 6 7\n\nTeen gets back on track \n with help from Club school \n Floyd, 13, was struggling and needed help. \n \u201cI feel like \n He had a lot of trouble learning virtually. With his Lorain school temporarily closed\n due to the pandemic, Floyd\u2019s grades and his interest in virtual classes plummeted.\n I\u2019ve become \n He was falling behind. \n Two things helped Floyd get back on track. His Club, BGCNEO\u2019s Desich Family\n a better \n Campus, became a ClubSmart Learning Center, where kids like him could receive\n in-person and tech help with their schoolwork. Then his new school, Southview\n person.\u201d \n High School, opened its doors two days a week. \n \u201cMy grades,\u201d Floyd says with a smile, \u201cwent up like crazy.\u201d \n The double dose of Club help and the return of in-school classes were a relief to\n Floyd and his aunt, with whom he lives. She is a former nurse who can no longer\n work due to a disability. \n When he first joined the Boys & Girls Club, Floyd was, by all accounts, an angry\n kid. Staff members showed him techniques by which he could control his anger\n and have more fun. Today, he is a walking, talking advertisement for the Club and\n its ability to transform young lives. \n \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become a better person,\u201d Floyd says. \u201cI rarely get mad, and I am a\n lot happier.
