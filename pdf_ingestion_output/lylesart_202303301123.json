The\n impression is to link middle level students and professional artists through advanced visual education, analog to\n digital media literacy, and social conservation that utilizes visual learning.\n Each student participate will be provided two disposable cameras, assigned with socially relevant topics, that tackle\n what is unique or different about where they're from and how they see their community.\n Art Instructional Workshops (03 to 05/2023). Youth participants will engage with multiple hour presentations\n focusing on instructional assignments. \n The project will expand as a community hands-on learning platform. Cleveland community outreach participation\n (04 to 05/2023). This portion of the project involves installing cameras in accessible public places, and let curious\n passers take photographs of themselves. \n Disposable cameras, will hang onto tree branches and infrastructure, high enough for people to take notice.\n Rotate and distribute the cameras in deferent locations throughout Cuyahoga County during a one-month cycle.\n Leaving the cameras available to use by the public for 48 to 72 hours before collecting and processing them.\n All images will be developed and edited. Students and teaching artists will review, and refine the final images for\n reproduction to be exhibited in virtual and public spaces. Everyone will have access to the Artography project\n website; https://artography.art \n (06 to 11/2023) \n Our community partners and teaching artist professionals provide resourceful opportunities and creative\n proficiencies that facilitates assets towards our mission. For the Artography project we have aligned with:\n \u2022 Cleveland Metropolitan School District \n \u2022 Cleveland Public Library \n \u2022 East Cleveland Public Library \n \u2022 Local Artists \n \u2022 Community Volunteers \n 6 / 17\n\nPublic Benefit \n 2a. Define your community. How will you engage your community to carry out your project?\n Tip: A community may be defined by geography (place), identity (attributes) or affinity (what we like). The best way to\n demonstrate your project\u2019s public benefit is to demonstrate that you share power with your community by\n understanding, respecting, working with, and responding to them. \n The Artography Project is designed to address and recognized the diverse health of the Cuyahoga County\n community by stimulating its ability to preserve and invent its culture. Our mission is investing in youth development\n through artist mentorship. \n The direct community that we will serve through this project is the region of Cleveland and its various\n neighborhoods. Our primary audience are young-adults, ages 13-25. A deliberate outreach will solicit the\n participation from family, local residents, businesses, organizations, artists, and government officials.\n Many young adults in Cleveland have little access to revitalization processes in their community. Choosing specific\n locations for different reasons.This project becomes a diary of people places and things explored. Through\n Artography, we engage in visual dialog to build connections between the contrasted uses of imagination in\n constructing public benefit and the role of interpretation as a tool of shared innovated abilities.\n 7 / 17\n\n2b. How will your project build and strengthen meaningful relationships with your community, residents, and\n audiences including through efforts to be inclusive and to engage diverse populations?\n The project enmeshes the support from the students from Sunbeam PK-8 School and Anton Grdina Academy\n which necessitates parental support and community engagement. Parents will be encouraged to partake in the\n composition of the photograph exploring various images using a disposable camera provided by the project.\n Students will be taught the basics of photography and partake in the development of the community wide project\n that will portray the diversity of Cuyahoga County. \n It is obvious that in order to vitalize and sustain the growth of the community an initiative that affirms creative\n development is needed. The Artography project attempts to embolden public community value by acting as a\n catalyst for building multiple skills by moving youth towards a greater sense of self, providing a sense of meaning\n and purpose in their community as they work alongside artist mentors emphasizing various areas of development\n and readiness. \n Artistic & Cultural Vibrancy \n 3. Describe how your organization will create a quality project that inspires and challenges your community.\n It is important that all people have exposure to artistic cultural events. We believe that our mission, \u201cto engage\n youth to actively enrich their communities through development in art and growth in fine art appreciation\u201d is in direct\n correlation with CAC\u2019s mission. \u201cWe strongly believe\u201d this project warrants public funds because the sole purpose is\n to inspire and cultivate the public to engage in ART. The Artography project address social needs and challenges\n by forming an artistic collaboration between neighborhoods, students and teaching art professionals. This project\n seeks to bridge the gap between the community and the artistic scope, building a visual, educational and social\n forum and most of all, the joy that a person receives exploring various creative ways to take a photograph.\n Organizational Capacity \n 8 / 17\n\n4a. Describe your team. Include who will be involved and how they are qualified to complete your project.\n Our role as an Arts and Cultural Organization attempts to embolden community value by acting as a catalyst for\n building multiple skills by moving youth towards a greater sense of self, providing a sense of meaning and purpose\n in their community as they work alongside creative mentors emphasizing critical thinking, creative skills and\n important career readiness. \n All programming will employ regional and local teaching artists of color whose work is of the highest artistic and\n cultural merit. The featured artists are a group of art professionals who exemplify and believe that the process\n towards positive change is cultivated and developed over time, rather than being something that one just\n mechanically instructs. \n Creative workshops are structured so that participants find themselves having to work collaboratively with all other\n participants regardless of their differences. This process stimulates creative thinking outside the box to solve\n problems, create and execute impactful work. \n 9 / 17\n\n4b. Set one project goal. In addition to completing this project, what goal does your organization want to\n accomplish within this project? \n Tip: Institutional goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-targeted, inclusive, and\n equitable (SMARTIE) aims that an organization develops to achieve its mission. \n Goal The goal is to provide a platform for youth learning\n opportunities, art education and community\n outreach to residents of Cleveland. Including young\n people as meaningful contributors in the social and\n economic aspects of community building must not\n be overlooked and cannot be left to schools and\n parents alone. Engaging youth is a dual benefit: it\n brings more adults into the picture. This gets people\n more involved in community affairs by helping to\n improve conditions for youth. \n How will you know you have accomplished or made The rationality of evaluation is data-driven based\n on existing regional needs within the lack of art-based\n progress towards your goal? \n instruction within the educational clement.\n Based on internal to external goals we survey and\n evaluate our program participants and measure these\n components based on achievement: \n \u2022 Engaging youth to enrich their communities\n through art development \n \u2022 Increase knowledge of contributions to the\n narration of art. \n \u2022 Sustain the growth of art and enmeshing youth\n to enrich their neighborhoods. \n 10 / 17\n\n5.
