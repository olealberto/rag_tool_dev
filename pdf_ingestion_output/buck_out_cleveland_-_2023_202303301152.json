Define your community \n Who does your organization regularly engage? Whose feedback informs your decisions?\n Buck Out Cleveland serves aspiring dancers from historically under-resourced communities in northeast Ohio,\n including inner-city Cleveland and East Cleveland, Ohio. Our primary community is young women between the\n ages of nine and nineteen. We aim to provide exposure for students who would not otherwise have access to\n high-quality professional dance training. The needs of our dancers informs what we prioritize and how we plan our\n programming. \n 2. How does your organization build relationships with and respond to its defined community?\n Buck Out Cleveland works with schools, community organizations, and individuals to identify Buck Out program\n participants. For example, Buck Out provided professional instruction to dance teams at Glenville High School,\n Warrensville Heights High School, Euclid High School, and Central Middle School. The delivery of professional\n education from Buck Out Cleveland\u2019s instructors led several students to enroll in Buck Out programs and to\n participate in Buck Out Cleveland's annual showcase entitled \"Halftime.\" \n The organization also relies heavily on the input and support of the community to execute its programs. The Buck\n Out Cleveland team is made up of Cleveland and East Cleveland residents with a deep understanding of\n community needs. The team intentionally engages community organizations and residents through public forums\n and social media. Furthermore, Buck Out Cleveland has a booster club composed of parents and supporters of the\n organization. \n 3 / 13\n\n3. Describe how your organization reaches out to the wider public. \n How might a new resident learn about your work? How do you market your pubic-facing events?\n Buck Out Cleveland focuses on reaching Black women and girls interested in dance through digital platforms\n including Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Buck Out Cleveland\u2019s audience has grown consistently for over six\n years. Captivating concept videos and distinctive branding keep engagement and awareness of programs high.\n The team also leverages relationships with influencers in the HBCU dance community to draw people to the\n organization. The organization has an active social media presence with over 5,300 Instagram followers, 210+\n YouTube subscribers, and over 550 Facebook followers. In addition, Buck Out Cleveland maintains connections\n with media outlets that aid in spreading the word about upcoming events and the organization\u2019s impact. Student\n dancers and their parents also lead word-of-mouth and community engagement efforts.\n Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy Narratives \n CAC defines Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy as an organization\u2019s ability to create quality, mission-driven work that\n inspires and challenges its community. \n 1. Describe the team of arts and culture professionals that carries out your work.\n LaChanee Davis leads Buck Out Cleveland. LaChanee is a graduate of Alabama State University and a former\n Stingette. She is also a former dancer and a current assistant coach for the NBA Cleveland Cavaliers dance\n department. LaChanee aspires to strengthen, empower, and inspire motivated individuals by developing their\n talents in dance. The Buck Out Cleveland team also includes former and current professional and collegiate\n dancers and current students who support programming and administration. Students lead the enrollment and\n recruitment process for the organization. \n Most of the administrative work of the organization is done by the Director, LaChanee Hipps, along with skilled\n interns from local universities and dance students. \n 4 / 13\n\n2. Describe how you engage individuals and/or organizations in authentic partnerships. How do you build the\n capacity of arts and culture professionals? \n Buck Out Cleveland works with local schools, community organizations, and individuals to identify students\n participating in programming. Without those connections, students would likely miss the opportunity to be a part of\n Buck Out Cleveland. Buck Out Cleveland also has formal partnerships with The City of Cleveland and Rainey\n Institute to provide dance classes for community members free of charge. These partnerships also expand Buck\n Out\u2019s reach in the community. \n 3. Describe a recent programmatic highlight that celebrates the unique artistic contributions of your\n organization. How did this work inspire the community to think creatively and/or differently?\n The organization recently created a viral concept video entitled \"Freedom.\" The idea of \"Freedom\" was sparked by\n the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter Movement. Not only did the movement cause canceled\n rehearsals and curfew mandates from the riots happening in downtown Cleveland, but it also caused a lot of\n emotional trauma for the dancers as they noticed the changes in the dynamic of their community and the world.\n When LaChanee, asked for suggestions from dancers on the theme for their first visual concept, the dancers felt\n the need to dedicate a performance to this movement to provide an empowering and enlightening message. The\n \"Freedom\" video inspired the dancers to use their art as a form of protest and expression. The video also inspired\n the broader community to use their respective platforms to make a difference. \n 4. How do you reflect on your current programming? What feedback or changes do you plan to implement in\n the next two years? \n Buck Out Cleveland often reflects on its programming to ensure that we meet our dancers' holistic needs. While the\n organization has successfully grown its programmatic reach, it relies heavily on volunteers to operate. Currently, our\n volunteer Executive Director leads our programmatic and administrative efforts. Over the next two years, we plan to\n provide a livable salary to the Executive Director and other staff members to ensure that resources are available to\n execute programs at maximum capacity. \n Buck Out Cleveland has peaked as a small nonprofit organization with primarily volunteer staff members. We\n gained momentum with our most recent viral concept videos and increased demand for programs. Now is the time\n to add staff so that the organization can continue making dreams a reality for youth from the inner-city who do not\n readily have access to the fundamental training to make careers in dance possible.\n 5 / 13\n\nOrganizational Capacity Narratives \n CAC defines Organizational Capacity as an organization\u2019s ability to successfully manage resources to their best use\n now and for years to come. \n 1. Describe the board, staff, and/or volunteers that steward your organization. How do you recruit for and\n engage with this group? \n Board engagement slightly waned during the pandemic; however, the board is now working on engaging and\n growing. Our three active board members are currently working on prospecting and recruiting new members. Our\n goal is to add three new board members by the end of the year and four additional board members in 2023. Board\n members have worked in an advisory capacity and have been avid fundraisers for the organization. In addition, our\n booster club, a group of active parents, supports the organization's fundraising efforts and events.\n 2. Describe your organizational planning process for the current year. How do you know that you are on track?\n Who is key to this process, both within your organization and outside it? \n We have a three-year strategic plan that outlines our goals and objectives for the next three years. Every program\n we conduct must align with at least one of the areas of our strategy. Alignment with the strategic plan keeps us\n focused and on track. Our Executive Director, Board of Directors, and Instructors all play a part in ensuring that we\n maintain our alignment with the strategic plan. Furthermore, our strategic plan informs the types of organizations\n we partner with outside the organization. \n 6 / 13\n\n3. Describe your organization\u2019s current financial situation. How does your organization plan strategically to\n achieve and maintain a strong financial position? Who set your organization\u2019s current fiscal year budget and\n how are they qualified? \n Buck Out Cleveland\u2019s operating budget is approximately $200,000 per year. The budget has grown as the\n programming has expanded over the years. We rely heavily on outreach contracts and tuition from our in-studio\n dance company to meet our critical budget needs. We also maintain a strong pipeline of local and national funders\n to support our work. We also have a development plan that includes event ticket sales, individual donor\n campaigns, fundraising events, and crowdfunding.

How \n often? (insert explanation) \n Explanation Through 2021, our board met regularly up until the\n holiday season.

The budget has grown as the\n programming has expanded over the years. We rely heavily on outreach contracts and tuition from our in-studio\n dance company to meet our critical budget needs. We also maintain a strong pipeline of local and national funders\n to support our work. We also have a development plan that includes event ticket sales, individual donor\n campaigns, fundraising events, and crowdfunding. Moreover, Buck Out Cleveland will connect with corporate\n sponsors to provide additional support. \n 7 / 13\n\nOrganizational Capacity Assessment \n Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d to each question below.
