"research methodology, responsible conduct of research, and career development. To learn presentation skills and principles of rigor and reproducibility, students will co- lead, with a research mentor, journal clubs and works-in-progress sessions. Additional novel aspects of the program include use of peer-to-peer mentoring and ongoing exposure to successful early career physician- scientists. At the end of the summer, students will present at a SRTP Research Symposium and the COM Research Day. After the program is completed, the program will utilize multiple strategies to facilitate continued involvement in research activities, including encouraging students to apply to the James Scholar Program, a program that provides the infrastructure to support research during the second to fourth years of medical school. In addition, the program will strive to create a sense of community among SRTP cohorts by hosting quarterly “Ideas on Tap” (research/social networking events at which students present ongoing research), and will maintain connections with trainees using the program website, newsletters, an SRTP Slack communication channel, and social media. An Executive Committee will oversee implementation of the program, recruitment/selection, program evaluation, and tracking of short- and long-term outcomes. Strengths of the program include the experienced co-Directors, committed and well-funded program mentors with broad expertise across NIDDK mission areas, an innovative structured curriculum, a robust recruitment plan to enhance diversity, strong institutional support, and a thoughtfully conceived plan to foster continued research involvement after program completion. Consequently, the proposed SRTP will provide medical students with a substantive research experience, facilitating the achievement of the long-term objective of increasing the pipeline and diversity of physicians entering the research workforce in NIDDK mission areas.",section,methods,1243.0,3202.0,268,5T35DK131960-03,Short-Term Research Training Program in NIDDK Mission Areas,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5T35DK131960-03_chunk0,,,

Adults with uncontrolled asthma (n=320) on standard controller therapy will be equally randomized and assessed at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months. The control and intervention groups will be matched on the number, frequency, and format of sessions over 12 months while the length of each session is proportional to the content delivered. Control participants will receive education on lung health, asthma, and other general health topics using American Lung Association and UpToDate materials. The intervention group will receive the same health education and materials in addition to DASH behavioral counseling. Central hypothesis: Compared with the education-only control, the DASH behavioral intervention will lead to significantly more participants with a clinically significant improvement (responders) in asthma-specific quality of life (primary outcome) and significantly greater improvements in related asthma and non-asthma outcomes, which will be mechanistically linked to improved diet quality.",section,methods,1019.0,2235.0,176,5R33HL155160-04,"The ALOHA trial: Addressing Quality of Life, Clinical Outcomes, and Mechanisms in Uncontrolled Asthma Following the DASH Dietary Pattern",2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R33HL155160-04_chunk1,,,

"This is an application to the Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) NIH-wide program part of the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program. Sulfur mustard (SM), a chemical warfare agent, and nitrogen mustard (NM), a chemotherapeutic agent, are both potent vesicants. The cornea is exquisitely sensitive to these agents leading to keratitis, vascularization, ulceration, and perforations. Following acute SM exposure, a subset of patients will experience chronic/delayed-onset ocular complications known as mustard gas keratopathy (MGK). Delayed MGK reportedly can manifest several years after the initial exposure and presents with severe corneal disease with significant visual loss. We have made the observation that in experimental animal models of NM injury to the cornea, there is dose-dependent increased senescence in the cornea. We hypothesize that senescence in the cornea promotes tissue dysfunction and inflammationand that senescence after mustard injury contributes to the progression of chronic MGK and the severity of delayed MGK. We further hypothesize that reducing/eliminating senescent cells may alter the progression and severity of MGK. In this application we propose in Aim1 to investigate the role of senescence and SASP in the progression of corneal disease following acute exposure to NM; and in Aim 2 to investigate the role of senescence in a new model of delayed MGK.

"PROJECT ABSTRACT The inflammatory cell death program pyroptosis occurs in a wide range of cell types and plays important roles in development, tissue injury, and tumor growth. Curiously, unlike other cell death mechanisms, cells frequently survive pyroptosis activation. The persistence of a family of “inefficient” cell death genes is puzzling and suggests they may have other roles. Intuitively, cells that survive the inflammatory insult will dictate both the short-term adaptation and long-term repair and regeneration afterwards. Therefore, a flawed death program may actually be a “trial”. However, the details of cell survival after pyroptosis and the biochemical circuitry beyond its activation are under-studied, hindering our basic understanding. In this Program, we hypothesize that cell death is a side- effect of pyroptosis, which in fact aims to reprogram cell functions. To explore the new concept that “trial-by-fire” provides strong evolutionary advantages, we will investigate 1) whether it is possible to stop/resume pyroptosis and the basic mechanisms used to exert such control; 2) the capacity and limits of pyroptosis signaling; and 3) the single cell phenotypic effects of weathering pyroptosis. In pursuing this central hypothesis, we will discover new cell signaling circuits and simultaneously enhance the field’s ability to detect novel pathways by developing new genetically encoded tools, imaging algorithms, and bioinformatics",section,abstract,48.0,1506.0,210,5R35GM146936-03,Pyroptosis is a Trial-by-Fire Program,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R35GM146936-03_chunk8,,,

"specific aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct secondary analyses of baseline data from a large HIV prevention intervention involving SA-AGYW and their female caregivers (IMARA-SA). Analyses of 642 AGYW will examine mental health distress, IPV, and AGYW-caregiver warmth and communication as drivers of AGYW sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Preliminary data from the parent study revealed high rates mental health distress and IPV. I hypothesize that increased warmth and communication between AGYW and female caregivers will decrease the association between mental health distress and sexual risk behaviors even in the presence of IPV. In Aim 2, I will supplement the quantitative analysis with 20- 30 qualitative interviews with SA-AGYW with experiences of IPV. I will purposively select participants from the parent study who have completed the 12-month follow up and reported IPV. Interviews will offer new insight into the impact of female caregiver communication about addressing experiences of IPV and sexual risk behavior. The findings from aims 1 and 2 will inform interventions to improve the SA-AGYW mental health, lessen IPV exposure, and strengthen sexual and reproductive health.

"The development of type II diabetes (T2D) is strongly associated with obesity, and both are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Vascular dysfunction is an early event in developing cardiovascular disease in obese diabetic (OB-T2D) patients.

Therefore, we set our long-term goal to define molecular mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and corrective strategies that target these mechanisms, such as physical activity and weight loss.

We recently discovered that human adipose tissues release extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) that are efficiently captured by endothelial cells.

Adiposomes are known to carry bioactive cargos such as proteins and micro RNAs; however, their lipid content has not been studied, neither their ability to transfer their lipid cargo to endothelial cells.

In the current application, we propose investigating the role of adiposomes in communicating the unhealthy milieu, mainly dysregulated lipids, to endothelial cells in OB-T2D subjects.

On top of these lipid species that we propose to be carried by adiposomes are glycosphingolipids (GSLs).

GSLs originate from ceramide glycosylation, a chemical process that is upregulated in the presence of inflammation and high glucose levels.

Our preliminary findings showed that in endothelial cells, GSL-rich adiposomes disturb plasma membrane structure and subsequently induces endothelial dysfunction.

Moreover, we found preconditioning endothelial cells with high shear stress (which is an exercise mimetic) protected endothelial cells from the detrimental effects caused by adiposomes.

Therefore, our central hypothesis is that adipose tissues in OB-T2D patients release GSL-loaded adiposomes that induce vascular endothelial dysfunction.",results,semantic_chunk,,,238,5R01HL161386-03,Role of Adiposomes in Diabetes-Associated Endothelial Dysfunction and Restorative Effects of Exercise and Metabolic Surgery,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01HL161386-03_chunk11,False,False,False
"We propose that exercise and weight loss interventions (bariatric surgery) will restore adipose tissue homeostasis, reduce GSL-loaded adiposomes, and subsequently alleviate vascular risk in OB-T2D patients.

We will test our hypotheses by pursuing the following Aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of GSL-rich adiposomes in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in OB- T2D adults; Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of exercise training in reducing adiposome-mediated effects on vascular function; and Aim 3: Examine changes in adiposome/caveolae axis following metabolic surgery and their association with vascular function.

This study will improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological underpinning of adiposome production, packaging, and role in inducing ED under conditions of obesity and T2D.

It will also identify adiposomes and the proposed mechanisms of their interaction with endothelial cells as novel therapeutic targets for improving vascular function in OB-T2D individuals.

Once these pathways are elucidated, strategies for targeting them can be advanced, leading to an improved therapeutic management of T2D-related cardiovascular disease.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,160,5R01HL161386-03,Role of Adiposomes in Diabetes-Associated Endothelial Dysfunction and Restorative Effects of Exercise and Metabolic Surgery,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01HL161386-03_chunk12,False,False,True

This proposal focuses on fundamental amplification mechanisms underlying the maladaptive inflammatory activation of the lung endothelium. Our central hypothesis is that the inflammatory response to threat signals such as the initial breaching of the endothelial plasma membrane by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rapid release of mitochondrial DNA by the injured mitochondria into the cytosol massively and acutely amplifies the inflammatory response and thus serves as essential feed-forward mechanisms for progression of acute lung injury (ALI).

We will address the role of amplifying K+ efflux on the severity and rapidity of endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and fulminant lung injury. In Aim 2, we will define another crucial amplification mechanism, the potentially important role of Gasdermin D-mediated mitochondrial (mt) membrane pore formation and the release of mtDNA, which may also catastrophically amplifiy lung injury via activation of Type I interferon signaling.

DMP1 (dentin matrix protein1) is a key regulatory protein in bone and dentin mineralization.

We first demonstrated that it has a regulatory role in the regulation of hydroxyapatite nucleation and growth in the extracellular matrices of bone and dentin.

Subsequently, we demonstrated that DMP1 was localized in the nucleus of preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts and thus served as a signaling molecule and promoted the differentiation of these precursor cells.

Recently we discovered that DMP1 can stimulate the release of intracellular calcium in preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts.

Depletion of intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum leads to ER stress.

Cells cope with ER stress by activating the “Unfolded protein response” (UPR).

One of our recent observations is that DMP1 stimulation can promote the secretion of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors.

Therefore, we hypothesize that ER stress activated by DMP1 functions to promote the transformation of adult stem cells such as dental pulp stem cells to endothelial cells and thereby promote vasculogenesis.

In order to determine the mechanism by which DMP1 promotes vasculogenesis, we will examine the UPR signaling pathway.",general,semantic_chunk,,,231,5R01DE031737-03,Role of DMP1 Mediated Paracrine Signaling in Vasculogenesis,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01DE031737-03_chunk33,False,False,False
"The UPR is initiated by three ER transmembrane proteins, of which our preliminary data show that DMP1 stimulation activated the ATF6 (Activating Transcription Factor 6) arm of the UPR.

Accordingly, here we propose to study the mechanism by which ATF6 mediate transcriptional regulation of VEGF under ER stress.

During dentin repair and regeneration, a major challenge is the maintenance of cell viability which depends on the availability of a functional vascular system.

Accordingly, we will test the in-vivo vasculogenic competence and therapeutic potential of DMP1 in an in vivo pulp regeneration model.

Understanding the complex functions of DMP1 could be valuable to develop therapies for fracture repair in bone or in the tooth to restore lost, damaged or diseased dentin-pulp complex.",results,semantic_chunk,,,121,5R01DE031737-03,Role of DMP1 Mediated Paracrine Signaling in Vasculogenesis,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01DE031737-03_chunk34,False,False,False

"result of withdrawal symptoms that emerge during early abstinence from alcohol. Despite this, pharmacotherapeutics for the treatment of withdrawal are lacking, at least in part, due to poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying symptoms of withdrawal. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is a GABAergic region that exerts inhibitory control over midbrain bioaminergic and cholinergic nuclei. Recently, work from our lab revealed significantly enhanced cFos expression, a marker of recent neuronal activity, in the RMTg of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposed rats 12 hours into acute withdrawal. In addition, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of the RMTg attenuates withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. However, the precise neural circuits that drive this putative RMTg hyperactivity is unknown. The lateral habenula (LHb) provides dense glutamatergic input to the RMTg and exhibits significant functional overlap with the RMTg. In addition, our preliminary data reveals a significant increase in cFos expression in RMTg-projecting lateral habenula (LHb) neurons during acute withdrawal. Together, these data lead us to hypothesize that LHb inputs to the RMTg play a mechanistic role in regulating symptoms of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. Experiments in the current proposal are designed to test this hypothesis by using in vivo chemogenetics to bidirectionally and selectively manipulate LHb-RMTg activity during behavioral tests of withdrawal symptoms including anxiety-like behavior, mechanical pain sensitivity, and impulsive choice. Additional work will use ex vivo slice electrophysiology to explore the physiological neuroadaptations that occur in this circuitry during withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. Findings from these experiments will shed new light onto the role of this neural circuit in regulating symptoms of withdrawal and by extension have the potential to uncover new neurobiological targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.",section,results,87.0,2092.0,279,5R01AA031003-02,Role of RMTg afferents in mechanisms of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01AA031003-02_chunk36,,,

"We have discovered a new mechanism for inflammation on the ocular surface.

First, we discovered the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) on the ocular surface of dry eye disease (DED) patients and subsequently, the presence of citrullinated proteins and anti- citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs).

ACPAs not only cause ocular surface disease, but also stimulate formation of NETs, thus creating a self-perpetuating cycle of chronic inflammation on the ocular surface.

We present an innovative pathophysiological concept: DED is characterized by breach of self-tolerance towards citrullinated antigens with generation of autoantibodies (ACPAs) and NETs could represent a source of citrullinated antigens fueling the ACPA autoimmune response over the ocular surface.

We performed a first-in-human pilot clinical trial and showed that ocular surface immune globulin (OSIG) eye drops, formulated from pooled human immune globulin products (IVIG), were safe and efficacious in treating DED patients.

Our findings shift the current paradigm that focuses on T-cell mediated inflammation as central to the pathophysiology of DED to also include autoimmune inflammation that is driven by post- translational modifications in self-proteins (citrullination) and autoantibodies (ACPAs).

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Since December 2019, coordinated research efforts have provided a wealth of critical data that have enhanced our ability to diagnose and treat COVID-19.

To date, however, much of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remain elusive.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains nine independent open reading frames (ORFs) coding for proteins that are not essential for viral replication but seem to exert important functions in modulating host antiviral immunity.

Of these accessory proteins, the ORF8 protein stands out for its unique characteristics.

ORF8 is a highly variable protein among SARS-related CoVs.

ORF8 also appears to be involved in a network of host-pathogen interactions inside infected cells: ORF8 impairs immune pathways such as antigen presentation, interferon type I, and nuclear factor-kB, as well as possibly activate growth pathways.

A central question is how ORF8 mediates interactions with multiple host protein targets.

Towards this goal, we are investigating ORF8 interaction with major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules.

It was shown recently that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 suppresses CD8+ T cell responses by downregulating MHC I molecules, both in vitro and in vivo.

We hypothesize that ORF8 suppresses surface expression of HLA-A and HLA-B molecules to protect infected cells from recognition by CD8+ T cells, but spares HLA-C and HLA-E to avoid activation of natural killer (NK) cells.",results,semantic_chunk,,,234,1R21AI173863-01,Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2: the role of HLA class I,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,1R21AI173863-01_chunk46,False,False,False
"The possibility that ORF8 displays a locus specificity toward MHC I would provide a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 to walk a fine line between adaptive and innate immunity.

Specifically, we will undertake an analysis of interactions between ORF8 and MHC I by using a panel of HLA- A, -B, -C, and -E molecules, and also determine if ORF8 selectively downregulates MHC I in relevant cell systems (Aim 1).

We will extend these studies to ORF8 variants that have been positively selected during the course of the pandemic and evaluate if and how these mutations affect MHC I binding and downregulation (Aim 2).

The successful completion of these Aims is expected to uncover unknown features of ORF8 and elucidate its role in suppressing antigen presentation, as well as inform us on the selective pressure that MHC I exerts on SARS-CoV-2.

The immediate and long-term impact of our proposed research is high.

This is the first study that: (1) characterizes molecular interaction of ORF8 with a host protein; and (2) evaluates clinically relevant ORF8 variants.

By studying the immune interactions underlying ORF8-mediated downregulation of MHC I, we will increase our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 derails cellular immunity.

Importantly, our study will stimulate similar investigations of other ORF8-interactors, providing novel opportunities for the development of therapeutics directed against ORF8 or its host targets.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,219,1R21AI173863-01,Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2: the role of HLA class I,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,1R21AI173863-01_chunk47,False,False,True

"High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is both the most common and most lethal ovarian cancer histotype.

Though HGSOC has been long thought to originate in the ovary, recent evidence now suggests that HGSOC precursor lesions in fact originate in the fallopian tube.

Further, select dysplastic cells from the fallopian tube disseminate from these precursor lesions and follow a variety of local migratory cues in order to colonize the ovary and establish a primary HGSOC tumor.

The ovary seems to facilitate the expansion and spread of the ovary to the rest of the peritoneal space.

Though this phenomenon is well documented, the molecular mechanisms that drive the initial dissemination of dysplastic fallopian tube cells to the ovary are poorly understood.

To address this, our group has developed a new imaging mass spectrometry technique that has allowed for unprecedented insight into the paracrine factors that create a pro-metastatic niche and allow for the migration of fallopian tube cells toward the ovary.

Using this technique, we determined that co-culture of murine ovary explants with dysplastic tubal cells leads to consistent increases in norepinephrine secretion from the ovary, later found to be produced by the ovary itself.

This is significant, as norepinephrine is an established tumor promoter in advanced disease, and ovarian cancer patients taking β-blockers that interfere with norepinephrine signals typically have improved clinical outcomes.

"Approached Self- Learning Intervention in HIV/AIDS for Tajiks"" (MASLIHAT) prevention model. The model recruits and trains current and former Tajik migrants who inject drugs as ""peer educators"" in delivering the intervention to others in their social networks while simultaneously reducing their own risk. The MASLIHAT Intervention and our research efforts build synergistically on 3 theoretical models: social-cognitive-behavioral theory, social network theory and Yang's Theory of Migration. The model itself culturally adapts the successful SHIELD model, which is a CDC- designated evidence-based best practice intervention in the U.S., for use with Tajik labor migrants in Russia who inject drugs. This study will test the efficacy of the MASLIHAT intervention against a control condition designed to be equal to the intervention condition in the number of sessions, duration, and interest level. We will deliver MASLIHAT and control group interventions over 5 sessions with groups of 5 to 9 Tajik male migrants who inject drugs for a total of 10 groups for each intervention. The peer educators will share what they learned with others in their social networks, including the 2 network members who inject drugs whom they recruited for enrollment in the study. We will assess MASLIHAT and control participants and their Tajik male social network members at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-intervention.

By transforming their own risk behavior, and encouraging others at risk to do so as well, migrant peer educators can initiate positive changes at the individual and social network levels in both their host country and also their home country when they return.

"resulting in uracils and G-to-A mutations in the viral genome. The products of retrovirus reverse transcription (ssRNA, ssDNA and dsDNA) are also sensed by host nucleic acid sensors. Sensor binding to viral nucleic acid leads to the production of anti-viral cytokines and chemokines, such as type I interferons, which “warns” surrounding cells to arm themselves against infection by producing proteins such as A3. These host anti-viral events are believed to occur largely in the cytoplasm, where A3 proteins and many host sensors are believed to function. Retroviruses enter cells when the viral and host membranes fuse and capsids are deposited in the cytoplasm. Reverse transcription initiates from within the capsid and capsid dissociation and reverse transcription are mutually dependent; because DNA is more rigid than RNA, without capsid dissociation, reverse transcription cannot proceed and conversely, the generation of DNA facilitates capsid dissociation. The reverse transcription complex not only consists of viral RNA, DNA and the viral proteins reverse transcriptase and integrase, but viral capsid and other proteins such as the MLV protein p12, which is needed for tethering of the proviral DNA to host chromatin to achieve integration. Recently, there has been much debate as to whether reverse transcription occurs solely in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus or both. Our lab pioneered the use of in vivo mouse models to study how A3 proteins restrict retrovirus infection and has used A3 and nucleic acid sensor knockout (KO) mice and genetically engineered animals that express human A3 proteins in these studies. Our data, based on our analysis of A3 KO mice and cells, suggest that the initial step occurs in the cytoplasm but that reverse transcription may also occur in the cytoplasm. With these mouse models, we have the tools to carry out in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies to determine how A3-mediated restriction and sensing of reverse transcripts are integrated with reverse transcription and nuclear entry for MLV and its natural host, the mouse. To accomplish this, we propose 3 aims, that will determine: I. Where in the cells APOBEC3 proteins block reverse transcription or deaminate viral DNA; II. What stage in reverse transcription and where in the cell the host base excision repair enzyme, UNG, removes uracil from APOBEC3G-deaminated viral DNA and the consequences of this for viral escape; III. Whether host sensing of viral nucleic acid takes place in the cytoplasm, nucleus or both compartments. Determination of when and where these events occur is critical to understanding how retroviruses, including HIV, evade host immunity and the identification of which steps are likely to be the best targets for interventional therapies at the early stages of infection.",section,results,866.0,3673.0,441,1R01AI174538-01,Interplay between reverse transcription and host restriction,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,1R01AI174538-01_chunk75,,,

"PROJECT SUMMARY Colorectal cancers (CRC) are characterized as having a hierarchical organization requiring proliferating and de-differentiated stem cells to maintain tumor growth and progression.

Cellular plasticity underlying colorectal cancer is essential for a process which occurs following selective pressures of the tumor microenvironment and chemotherapeutics.

The colonic tumor microenvironment is characterized by extreme hypoxia due to the anoxic lumen.

Hypoxia promotes metabolic rewiring, and such processes are utilized by cancer cells to support biosynthesis, cell survival and dynamic alteration in cell fates.

A critical feature of cellular metabolism is organellar interaction and coordination, yet how these contribute to CRC plasticity, survival, progression and treatment response are unclear.

Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS) are the most abundant inter-organellar interaction.

I generated a panel of ERMCS reporter CRC cell lines, and through unbiased high content imaging and CRISPR screens, I have identified essential mechanisms required for ER- mitochondrial interactions in CRC.

Moreover, I show a key role of tumor hypoxia in modulating ERMCS.

Hypoxia inhibited mitochondrial complex III and IV to decrease ERMCS.

Treating cells with the mitochondrial electron carrier, coenzyme (CoQ) rescued ERMCS suppression following hypoxia.

I hypothesize that tumor hypoxia regulates ER-mitochondrial contacts (ERMCS) by altering mitochondrial respiration and CoQ redox for metabolic adaptation and survival.

In aim 1 (F99 phase), I will focus on identifying the molecular mechanism of hypoxia dependent ERMCS inhibition and expand into in vivo models with our novel ERMCS reporter mouse model.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,237,5F99CA284256-02,Inter-organellar communication in metabolic reprogramming of colorectal cancer,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5F99CA284256-02_chunk92,False,False,True
"During the K00 phase, I will apply knowledge gained during graduate school in cancer metabolism and organellar interaction to an independent postdoctoral project.

The plasticity of colorectal tumor epithelium depends on integration of organellar functions to sustain metabolic demands.

Therefore, my goal as a postdoctoral fellow is to understand the dynamic changes and requirement for organellar interactions and metabolic compartmentalization during cell fates alterations in CRC.

I plan to use genetic murine and primary patient organoid models of CRC, volumetric electron microscopy, in vivo organellar metabolomics, and functional CRISPR screens to answer these questions.

Lastly, in addition to the proposed studies, this training plan includes activities important for career development, mentorship, networking, and scientific communication to prepare me for successful transition to a postdoctoral fellowship and my career as an independent investigator studying cancer metabolism.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,135,5F99CA284256-02,Inter-organellar communication in metabolic reprogramming of colorectal cancer,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5F99CA284256-02_chunk93,False,False,False
"Innovation and Opportunities Act (2014) to help prepare autistic transition-age youth for the workforce prior to existing high school. However, there are few evidence-based practices implemented within pre-employment transition services, which contribute to low employment rates among autistic transition-age youth. A limitation of pre-employment transition services is the job interview component, which utilizes teacher-led role-play training that lacks empirical validation, is resource-intensive, and does not adhere to best practices to train sustainable changes in behavior (e.g., repeated practice, scaffolding, token economy). Moreover, the autism community as voice the need for better job interview preparation. To fill this training need, our team (via R34 MH111531) partnered with the autism community to adapt Virtual Reality Job interview Training (VR-JIT, an internet-delivered job interview simulator with four levels of automated feedback with elearning job interview content) to meet the needs of autistic transition-age youth (now called Virtual Interview Training for Transition Age Youth (VIT)).

population.

The majority of those with VI and blindness are older adults aged ≥65 years.

Particularly in later life, VI is thought to be associated with a host of adverse outcomes, including dementia, admission to a long-term care facility, and even mortality.

Nonetheless, rigorous and generalizable research on how risk factors impact vision and eye health, and how vision influences late-life outcomes has been limited due to a lack of data that: (i) is longitudinal; (ii) is representative of the U.S.

population; (iii) contains objective assessments of visual function; and (iv) samples older adults.

In the proposed project, we will address this barrier using newly collected vision data from the NIH-funded National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), an ongoing nationally representative panel study of >7,000 adults aged ≥65 years.

In 2021, NHATS began annual measurement of distance and near visual acuity and contrast sensitivity.

"To do so, we will utilize individual-level indicators of risk factors from NHATS and neighborhood level-indicators from the NIH-funded National Neighborhood Data Archive that is linked to NHATS.

In Aim 3, we will investigate the longitudinal impact of VI and blindness on the development of dementia, placement in long-term care, and all-cause mortality.

In a sub-aim, we will use a longitudinal mediation model to test whether the influence of key risk factors on adverse late-life outcomes is mediated by vision and eye health.

To date, it has not been possible to carry out nationally representative studies on the associations of VI with risk factors and key late-life outcomes due to the lack of longitudinal and objectively measured visual function data in a national sample.

Thus, the proposed studies will address critical scientific gaps.

"resulting from Wnt promotion of stem cell proliferation. Although Wnt is well known to regulate GI stem cells, questions remain regarding sensitivity to Wnt dysregulation in different regions of the GI tract. Colonic manifestations in FAP patients are extreme, with aggressive disease characterized by early adenoma and cancer development, which commonly leads to colectomy at a young age. The consequences of Wnt dysregulation in gastric stem cells is less well understood, although polyp, adenoma and cancer development are enhanced in the FAP patient stomach. Notably, almost all FAP patients exhibit frequent hyperproliferative polyps localized to the proximal fundic/corpus region of the stomach, while, in contrast, the distal antral/pylorus region of the stomach is relatively spared from these polyps and develops more occasional adenomatous growths. The basis for the regional effect of FAP mutations on corpus vs. antral stem cells and gastric tissue responses is unknown. To address this important question, this project focuses on defining Wnt regulation of gastric stem cells to uncover the differential effects of pathway activation in the proximal vs. distal stomach. We will pursue the mechanisms of FAP polyp formation in the stomach by functional and genetic analysis of gastric polyp and non-polyp organoids and tissues from a biobank of human FAP gastric tissue samples that will be built as a component of this study. Human FAP organoid studies will be complemented by mouse genetic, pharmacologic and organoid models to gain deeper mechanistic insight into regional Wnt regulation of gastric stem cells. The studies are framed by the “Just Right Hypothesis” which defines differential sensitivities along the GI tract based on region-specific stem cell responses to different levels of Wnt activation. Together the proposed studies will determine how dysregulated Wnt signaling leads to differential gastric epithelial cell proliferation and polyp formation in proximal vs. distal stomach. This information will establish a scientific framework to help define the gastric manifestations in FAP patients. In addition, the studies will provide functional insights to develop a deeper understanding of Wnt pathway regulation of gastrointestinal stem cells. Furthermore, understanding mechanisms of Wnt pathway regulation of gastric stem cell function is important to refine strategies to propagate adult stem cells in culture for regenerative therapies as well as to develop diagnostic criteria and potential therapies for gastric hyperproliferative diseases.",section,results,578.0,3156.0,378,5R01DK126451-03,Wnt Pathway Regulation of Gastric Stem Cell Function,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01DK126451-03_chunk105,,,
"In the United States, nearly 1 in 6 adults filled an opioid prescription in the past year and 10 million adults are opioid tolerant.

Compared with opioid naïve patients, individuals with opioid tolerance experience greater challenges in managing acute pain especially after having surgery and poorer outcomes following surgical care.

For example, opioid exposure before surgery has been shown to lead to greater rates of opioid consumption after surgery.

Further, patients with opioid tolerance frequently encounter high-risk prescribing practices and delays in returning to their usual prescriber after surgery, as well as greater rates of morbidity and mortality after surgery.

Evidence-based care pathways have been developed to improve opioid prescribing before and after surgery for opioid-naïve patients, but little is known about the postoperative needs of patients with opioid tolerance.

Specifically, important knowledge gaps exist regarding the appropriate amount of opioids to prescribe after surgery, best practices in coordinating opioid therapy during the perioperative period, and the effectiveness of care coordination pathways to prevent high-risk prescribing practices and optimize clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population.

"Project Summary Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) represents the only curative therapy for most hematologic disease including leukemia.

HSCT requires donor HSCs to engage with the proper supporting niche, survive, proliferate, and differentiate into mature blood lineages.

Recent studies suggest that “stress hematopoiesis”, including that which occurs post-HSCT, is subject to distinct regulation compared steady-state hematopoiesis.

A better understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate transplanted HSCs and their engraftment is necessary to improve HSCT, especially in situations where transplant is limited by small cell numbers (e.g.

cord blood) or potentially compromised by ex vivo manipulation (e.g.

gene therapy).

Towards this, the main goal of this project is to identify and characterize novel key intrinsic regulators of HSCT.

My work reveals high expression of multiple GPRASPs (G-Protein Coupled Receptor Associated Sorting Proteins) (e.g.

Gprasp1 and Gprasp2) in HSCs, relative to downstream progenitors.

I have also found that both GPRASP1 and GPRASP2 act as negative regulators of HSCT.

Gprasp-deficient HSCs present enhanced homing, survival and quiescence during transplant.

This phenotype appears dependent on Cxcr4, a master regulator of HSCs function, whose sequence contains a putative GASP-binding motif.

Indeed, ectopic Cxcr4 enhances HSC homing, survival and quiescence during transplant, phenocopying loss of Gprasp1 or Gprasp2.

Further, my preliminary studies show that, upon Gprasp1 or Gprasp2 loss, CXCR4 is stabilized and accumulates on HSCs, sensitizing them to SDF-1.

CXCR4 has also been implicated in regulating cell-to-cell contact between B-cell progenitors and stroma cells.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,240,5R00DK123395-04,GPRASP family as novel regulators in hematopoietic stem cells,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R00DK123395-04_chunk111,False,False,True
"Interesting, my recent data suggests that GPRASP loss may also perturb B-cell production by blocking the differentiation of lymphoid progenitors.

Finally, although HSCs as a population are highly enriched for Gprasp1 and Gprasp2 expression, my recent analyses of single cell gene expression data and single HSCs by immunofluorescence reveals that the expression of these genes is heterogeneous amongst individual HSCs.

This differential expression corresponds with distinct gene expression profiles (e.g.

stemness, cell cycle, B-cell differentiation).

Although clonal analyses have revealed that even highly purified HSCs display diverse differentiation potential, the molecular regulation of this functional heterogeneity is currently poorly understood.

Thus, I hypothesize that multiple GPRASP family members regulate HSC transplantation and B-cell differentiation, and correlate with HSC functional heterogeneity.

The mentored phase of this proposal will occur at St.

Jude Children’s Research Hospital, under Dr.

Shannon McKinney-Freeman.

In the independent phase, I will confirm and extend my studies of the molecular link between GPRASPs and CXCR4 in HSCT and B-cell differentiation, as well as exploit novel molecular reporters to refine HSC functional heterogeneity.

"Because of the high mortality, morbidity, and health care costs associated with critical illness, identifying biological mechanisms that can be targeted to improve critical illness outcomes is an important public health priority.

Glucocorticoid treatment has been frequently studied in critically ill populations and can improve short- term survival as well as long-term mental health outcomes.

Full realization of the therapeutic potential of glucocorticoids in critical illness is hampered by gaps in our understanding of its mechanisms of action and by glucocorticoid resistance, which limits its efficacy.

Our future research program will focus on the theme of glucocorticoid mechanisms relevant to critical illness, with three main objectives.

First, our prior work led us to hypothesize that glucocorticoids improve mental health outcomes by enhancing factual memories from the ICU.

We will test this hypothesis in a population of sepsis survivors from our hospital.

Second, we propose a novel hypothesis about the importance of brainstem glucocorticoid signaling in the maintenance of cardiovascular and immune homeostasis.

We will test the role of glucocorticoid receptors in this specific brainstem area in the response to acute hypotensive and inflammatory challenges using the tools and skills that we have acquired for neural circuit interrogation.

".

Chronic pelvic pain remains a challenging condition to treat, in large part because underlying disease mechanisms are poorly understood.

Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP) is a common form of CPP wherein the severity of disease is only weakly associated with the degree of pain experienced.

While pelvic inflammation is a well-established contributing factor to EAPP, we propose that low-grade systemic inflammation also contributes to the disease state by promoting central nervous system (CNS) sensitization.

Emerging evidence from our group and others suggests that low-grade systemic inflammation can promote multiple aspects of CNS sensitization including clinical manifestations (comorbid pain conditions, widespread pain), hypersensitivity to experimental stimuli, and altered brain functional connectivity in pelvic pain.

While hormonal suppression is effective for many women, and acts in part by dampening estradiol-dependent pelvic inflammation, little is known about the relative contributions of low-grade systemic inflammation and CNS sensitization to EAPP.

We propose to use the FDA-approved, gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor antagonist, elagolix, available in two dosages, as a mechanistic probe to assess the effects of pelvic and systemic inflammation on EAPP.

The presence of robust dose-dependent effects on EAPP and its comorbid symptoms suggests to us that the higher dose also reduces CNS sensitization, possibly due to reduced systemic inflammation.",general,semantic_chunk,,,206,5R01HD108253-02,The impact of hormonal modulation on systemic inflammation and central sensitization,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01HD108253-02_chunk115,False,False,False

We will focus on two common patient phenotypes – those with EAPP only and those with EAPP and widespread pain (1:1 recruitment).

In Aim 1, we will first define the relationship between pelvic inflammation, systemic inflammation, and CNS sensitization using well-vetted neurobiological measures of CNS sensitization.

We anticipate that systemic inflammation will be associated with CNS sensitization, while pelvic inflammation will not be.

In Aim 2, we will identify dose-dependent changes in CNS sensitization as well as systemic and pelvic inflammation during hormonal suppression for EAPP through the above-described clinical trial.

We anticipate that both dosages will improve pelvic inflammation, but that systemic inflammation and CNS sensitization will be improved on high-dose elagolix.

We furthermore anticipate that those with widespread pain will be more likely to respond to high-dose elagolix.

In an exploratory Aim 3, we will determine if baseline levels of pelvic and/or systemic inflammatory activity, as well as CNS sensitization, predict the response to elagolix.

"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive primary brain tumor and is uniformly fatal with a median survival of around 1.5 years.

Like surgery and chemotherapy, radiation (RT) is a critical treatment for nearly every patient with GBM and has repeatedly improved patient survival in multiple randomized trials.

Still, 80% of GBMs recur within the high dose RT field.

Thus, there is a critical need to develop strategies to overcome GBM RT resistance to further improve patient outcomes.

GBM cells exhibit profound cancer-specific metabolic abnormalities, including elevated purine synthesis, to fuel proliferation, invasion and survival.

Using mice bearing intracranial orthotopic patient-derived brain tumors, my research has established that the metabolic phenotype of elevated purine synthesis also mediates resistance to RT in GBM by promoting the repair of RT-induced DNA damage.

This purine-mediated RT resistance can be overcome by treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an FDA-approved and CNS-penetrant inhibitor of purine biosynthesis.

In this research proposal I will determine how the RT response and purine synthesis regulate one another in GBM.

By employing a variety of cutting-edge metabolomic techniques and patient-derived GBM models, I will 1) define the biosynthetic pathway GBMs use to generate purines, and 2) determine the RT response mechanism by which GBMs increase purine levels to resist RT-induced DNA damage.",results,semantic_chunk,,,212,5F32CA260735-03,Targeting purine biosynthesis to radiosensitize glioblastoma,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5F32CA260735-03_chunk120,False,True,False

"background clearly plays a role, environmental factors, especially dietary nutrients, have been suspected as triggers to contribute to the disease development. Identifying the direct causal mechanisms by which genetics and dietary nutrients coordinately influence IBD susceptibility may provide direct utility in uncovering both how the disease develops and how it may be treated in the future. Although genetic factors appear to play relatively minor roles in IBD, there is one particular association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with IBD that showed up at the top of a recent genome-wide association screen in IBD: a common variant in the manganese transporter SLC39A8 (p.Ala391Thr). We and others have shown that this transporter is critical for the incorporation of manganese (Mn), a micronutrient required for many enzymatic activities. The SLC39A8 A391T variant was shown in vitro to have reduced Mn incorporating function, and we made similar observations independently. These revelations hint toward alterations in Mn levels caused by diet or genetics, as contributing factors for IBD. Yet, Mn deficiency has traditionally been rare in humans due to its various dietary sources. Mn is abundant in plant-based foods, including whole grains, rice, nuts, and leafy vegetables, whereas animal-based foods lack this nutrient. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed >40% reduction in dietary Mn consumption in the past 15 years due to a Western diet characterized by high intakes of red meats, high fat foods, and refined grains. This data is congruent with the increasing incidence of IBD, and it supports an inverse relationship between nutritional Mn levels and IBD patients. However, we still have not established if there is a causal role of Mn in IBD and the mechanism by which Mn contributes to IBD. This project will define functional insight into the roles of dietary Mn and SLC39A8 that maintain intestinal health, thereby advancing research into the etiology of IBD. Our findings will pave the way for future research in individuals at high risk of IBD to provide dietary recommendations and therapeutic targets.",section,background,212.0,2354.0,329,5R01DK123022-04,Manganese in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01DK123022-04_chunk123,,,
"results show that IL33 abundance correlates with disease progression and that fibroblast expression of IL33 is dependent on oncogenic Kras-driven signals from tumor cells. Additionally, we have completed a pilot experiment whereby we have orthotopically implanted pancreatic tumor cells into a syngeneic genetically engineered mouse model lacking Il33 in fibroblasts (Il33f/f, Pdgfra-CreERT2/+). Tumors from Il33-deficient mice had slower tumor growth and a trending decrease in macrophage infiltration, suggesting that fibroblast-derived Il33 is both tumor promoting and may play a role in the recruitment of immunosuppressive macrophages. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to elucidate the cellular interactions that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of immunosuppression in PDA, and the central hypothesis is that fibroblast derived IL33 is a key regulator of immunosuppression in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment through its modulation of macrophage infiltration. This hypothesis will be investigated through the following two Aims: (Aim 1) define the regulation and role of IL33 in cancer-associated fibroblasts, and (Aim 2) assess the impact of IL33 on the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. To complete this investigation, a combination of in vitro assays using tumor cell, fibroblast, and macrophage cultures will be performed. We also will continue to utilize the Il33f/f, Pdgfra-CreERT2/+ genetically engineered mouse model to assess Il33-dependent changes in the immunosuppressive nature of pancreatic tumors.

"The innate immune system detects pathogen-derived molecules to prevent infections via specialized immune receptors.

The immune receptors include cell surface-resident pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mammals and receptor kinases (RKs) in plants, and intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in plants and mammals.

Plant PRRs detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), whereas NLRs recognize pathogen-specific effectors, culminating in a unified immune system.

How the signaling networks underlying PRR- and NLR-mediated immunity are interconnected remains largely unknown.

In addition, defects or over-activation of immune receptors could lead to cell death or autoimmunity.

Thus, understanding the mechanisms that enable or constrain PRR and NLR activation for maintaining immune homeostasis is particularly important.

The PI’s laboratory has developed a series of sensitive and high-throughput genetic screens to dissect the complex activation and signaling mechanisms in plant immunity, and revealed the importance of malectin-like RKs (MLRs) as a molecular module at the plasma membrane linking PRR and NLR immune receptors.

PI’s long-term goal is to elucidate the signaling networks regulating innate immune responses using Arabidopsis as a model system and expand the knowledge of how hosts fend off infections without causing autoimmune disorders.

The proposed research rooted in PI’s previous discoveries and preliminary studies will support a series of projects that address several critical knowledge gaps in two interrelated research areas.

"PROJECT ABSTRACT Despite the availability of effective treatments, glaucoma remains the leading cause of irreversible blindness among African American adults and the second leading cause of irreversible blindness in the United States. Non-adherence to daily prescribed eye drop medications – the treatment for 89% of glaucoma patients - is a key modifiable driver of vision loss in glaucoma. In current practice, patients are diagnosed with glaucoma and simply given a prescription, with only 1 in 8 prescribing physicians teaching patients how to use eye drops. 40% of glaucoma patients do not take their daily eye drop medication according to the prescribed schedule. 20% of glaucoma patients do not succeed in getting drops into their eyes. Glaucoma primarily affects older adults who may have aging-related sensorimotor deficits that impair successful medication instillation. Our long term goal is to develop a comprehensive system to monitor medication use, quantify whether administered drops are successfully delivered, communicate usage data to the patient’s health care team, and coach each patient on how to use their eye drop medications. Our central hypothesis is that by identifying the biomechanical and sensorimotor factors associated with eye drop instillation success – whether a drop gets in the eye – we can develop more effective, personalized intervention strategies to improve medication adherence and increase instillation success.

To test this hypothesis, we plan to determine: 1) the extent to which macropinocytic internalization contributes to productive HIV entry into primary human CD4+ T cells; 2) the roles played by Env-receptor interactions in promoting HIV-1 macropinocytosis; 3) the influence of macropinosome environment on HIV-1 entry; and 4) the nature of post-internalization macropinocytosis function that promotes productive infection. The outcomes of the experiments outlined in this proposal will likely fill the knowledge gap in our understanding of HIV-1 entry, a fundamental aspect of the HIV-1 replication cycle, and help us develop or improve antiviral strategies that target virus entry and establishment of productive infection in CD4+ T cells.",section,results,1176.0,2922.0,252,5R01AI165381-02,Roles of Macropinocytosis in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T Cells,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01AI165381-02_chunk148,,,
"Project Summary Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a redox-active signaling molecule that modulates electron transport and energy metabolism, and by largely unknown mechanisms, mediates neuro- and cardioprotection, vasodilation, the hypoxic response, protein translation, epigenetics, aging, and both patho- and physiological responses in colon.

As H2S is also a respiratory poison at high doses, cells actively oxidize it to produce persulfides, sulfite, thiosulfate, (collectively referred to as reactive sulfur species), and sulfate.

Oxidative modification of protein cysteine thiols to persulfides is postulated to be a primary mechanism by which H2S signals.

The potential involvement of other reactive sulfur species in signaling is however, unknown.

Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that H2S impacts cellular redox metabolism via its dual effects on mitochondrial energetics, i.e.

increasing electron flux at low, and inhibiting it at high concentrations.

The highest exposure to exogenous H2S occurs in colon (0.2–2.4 mM) and is derived from gut resident microbiota, which synthesize sulfide.

Preliminary data in our laboratory reveal that colonic epithelial cells quantitatively oxidize exogenous H2S to thiosulfate, and that the localization and expression levels of sulfide oxidation enzymes in murine colonocytes are strongly influenced by the presence or absence of sulfate reducing bacteria in the gut.

"Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, which has the full complement of orthologous genes involved in H2S biogenesis and oxidation found in humans and is readily amenable to genetic and dietary manipulation and to life-span analyses, I will test my hypothesis by addressing the following two aims.

H2S levels and its oxidative byproducts will be modulated by exogenous H2S, RNA interference knockdowns of host sulfide oxidation enzymes, and by diet, using Escherichia coli with deletions in specific genes involved in sulfur metabolism.

(ii) I will investigate how differences in exogenous H2S exposure from air versus gut microbes affects the expression and localization of host sulfide oxidation enzymes, the abundance and type of reactive sulfur species, and their effect on lifespan.

"Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is one of at least nine diseases caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode abnormally long polyglutamine tracts in the disease proteins. Despite advances in disease understanding, much remains unknown about how the CAG expansion in the SCA3 disease gene, ATXN3, causes brain dysfunction and cell death. We recently discovered selective oligodendrocyte vulnerability across SCA3 mouse disease brain regions and identified early and robust changes that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. Our long-term objective is to understand pathogenic mechanisms in SCA3 and related polyglutamine diseases so that therapies targeting the most promising molecular and cellular targets can be developed for these fatal and currently untreatable disorders. Toward that objective, the team of investigators will leverage their diverse research expertise and a wide range of model systems including primary cell cultures, mouse models, and human disease tissue. Building on recent discoveries in mouse models and human disease tissue, we will investigate nonneuronal contributions to disease pathogenesis, with an emphasis on cells of the oligodendroglial lineage. In Aim 1, we will determine how widespread oligodendrocyte dysfunction is in SCA3 disease. In Aim 2, we will generate novel conditional SCA3 mouse models to establish if the mutant protein elicits cell-autonomous oligodendrocyte dysfunction and define oligodendrocyte dysfunction contributions to disease pathogenesis.

"PROJECT SUMMARY Eating behaviors are robustly associated with dietary quality and weight gain.

Given the relevance of eating behaviors to health in children and adults, remarkably little is known regarding the development of these behaviors from infancy, and their continuity (or discontinuity) into childhood.

Eating behaviors can be phenotyped in infancy through rigorous measurement of behavior following exposure to different stimuli under careful experimental control, though no studies prior to R01HD084163 have phenotyped multiple eating behaviors objectively in a single longitudinal infant cohort.

Eating behavior may be modifiable between infancy and early childhood, potentially altering any associations with future dietary quality or weight gain.

Interventions that promote adaptive maternal feeding practices have been effective in reducing obesity risk.

Intervention effects might be further strengthened by tailoring to characteristics of the individual child.

Identifying interactions of carefully phenotyped child eating behavior and maternal feeding practices in an observational cohort study is an important initial step towards future tailored intervention development.

The proposed work will examine for the first time the continuity (or discontinuity) of extensively phenotyped eating behaviors in infancy, based on novel objective measures and maternal report, to age 5 years.

The work will, for the first time, test whether maternal feeding practices and infant eating behaviors interact to predict child eating behaviors at age 5 years, as well as dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,228,5R01HD084163-09,"The Development of Eating Behavior in Infancy: Associations with Behavior, Diet, and Growth to Age 6 years",2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01HD084163-09_chunk154,False,False,True

"Project Summary Justice-involved Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are particularly vulnerable to HIV, and oftentimes experience delayed uptake and benefit from available HIV services.

Status neutral interventions for justice- involved BMSM are pertinent and urgently needed to address the social and structural barriers to HIV services (e.g., unemployment) experienced by this population.

Our collaborative has prioritized four status neutral interventions (i.e., transitional case management [TCM], employment navigation [EN], contingency management intervention [CMI], and employer outreach and support [EOS).

Combining these interventions together will maximize their independent effectiveness and provide significant promise for improving access to HIV and employment-related services for justice-involved BMSM.

"ABSTRACT ITM 3.0: ADVANCING HEALTH TOWARD HEALTH EQUITY THROUGHOUT METROPOLITAN CHICAGO The University of Chicago – Rush University Institute for Translational Medicine (ITM) was created in 2007 to assemble, integrate, and create the intellectual, administrative, and physical resources required to catalyze research and research training in Clinical and Translational Science. We have trained university scientists and health care providers as well as stakeholders from concerned communities to work together to determine the biological, behavioral, and social determinants of disease; to develop and test interventions directed toward those mechanisms; and to achieve these goals in a way that is rigorous, efficient, ethical, respectful of, and responsive to our communities’ priorities and values. The ITM has capitalized on outstanding intellectual and physical resources throughout UChicago, Rush, and ITM affiliate institutions – Loyola University Chicago, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Advocate Aurora Health Care, and Illinois Institute of Technology – and on substantial multi-institutional investments to build the sustainable infrastructure for a transformative, energetic, and self-improving home for clinical and translational research. Now, we pursue a bold guiding vision for “ITM 3.0” – that reversing the adverse health consequences of structural racism requires accounting for and mitigating the social, environmental, behavioral, and psychological factors (the entire lived experience, which we will call the “sociome”) through which structural racism impairs health. Focus on the sociome is critical because: 1) sociome factors interact with human biology to exacerbate or cause disease and injury, and 2) illness of any origin can compound the negative effects of adverse sociome factors. Since both sociome and biological systems, and their interactions, determine health, our CTSA hub must provide investigators, trainees, and stakeholders with the resources and knowledge to account for and address health disruptors throughout both systems. Our strategy to implement this vision is to create new training mechanisms, research platforms, communications channels, and safeguards against harm to ensure that all ITM investigators and institutions",section,abstract,49.0,2325.0,314,5UL1TR002389-08,The Institute for Translational Medicine,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5UL1TR002389-08_chunk163,,,

"PROJECT ABSTRACT The inflammatory cell death program pyroptosis occurs in a wide range of cell types and plays important roles in development, tissue injury, and tumor growth. Curiously, unlike other cell death mechanisms, cells frequently survive pyroptosis activation. The persistence of a family of “inefficient” cell death genes is puzzling and suggests they may have other roles. Intuitively, cells that survive the inflammatory insult will dictate both the short-term adaptation and long-term repair and regeneration afterwards. Therefore, a flawed death program may actually be a “trial”. However, the details of cell survival after pyroptosis and the biochemical circuitry beyond its activation are under-studied, hindering our basic understanding. In this Program, we hypothesize that cell death is a side- effect of pyroptosis, which in fact aims to reprogram cell functions. To explore the new concept that “trial-by-fire” provides strong evolutionary advantages, we will investigate 1) whether it is possible to stop/resume pyroptosis and the basic mechanisms used to exert such control; 2) the capacity and limits of pyroptosis signaling; and 3) the single cell phenotypic effects of weathering pyroptosis. In pursuing this central hypothesis, we will discover new cell signaling circuits and simultaneously enhance the field’s ability to detect novel pathways by developing new genetically encoded tools, imaging algorithms, and bioinformatics",section,abstract,48.0,1506.0,210,5R35GM146936-03,Pyroptosis is a Trial-by-Fire Program,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R35GM146936-03_chunk171,,,

"Specific Aims. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012 to increase the understanding of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Related to this goal was the improvement of patient-centered assessment of LUTS. This work involves improving the self-report measurement of LUTS using new, high-quality items to be used in questionnaire assessments. These items were created with qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. This set of items is referred to as the Comprehensive Assessment of Self-Reported Urinary Symptoms (CASUS). The original aims of the grant were Aim 1: To refine and expand a clinically-relevant cluster model across a cohort of patients with LUTS. Relative to LURN I, participants will have a wider range of symptom severity and be characterized using novel measures of bladder and urethral function; Aim 2: To identify protein biomarker signatures contained within plasma of specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; Aim 3: To determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; Aim 4 To validate comprehensive outcome tools for men and women with LUTS; and Aim 5: To determine influences of stress and mental health on LUTS. In this supplement, we will focus on the following additional activities: Aim 5.1. Determine the relationship between level of cognitive function and LUTS. LUTS increase with age and are associated with greater impairment in performing activities of daily living, lower mood, and poorer overall health quality. More recently, LUTS have been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The LURN II data present a unique opportunity to further elucidate the relationship between cognition and LUTS. Within Aim 5.1, our hypothesis is: Cognitive function, measured by BrainTest, which is based on the electronic version of the self-administered gerocognitive examination (eSAGE), will be related to LUTS; Aim 5.2. Determine baseline predictors of LUTS trajectories in a sample of men and women with urinary urgency. We will conduct separate analyses in men and women who have urinary urgency and other LUTS. We propose to create models of the trajectory of LUTS for each participant, and then relating these trajectories to patient health variables. We will explore baselines symptoms, combined with other health variables that have been explored in LURN I such as BMI, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. We also plan to explore psychosocial variables that have not been explored with respect to urgency: intolerance of uncertainty, catastrophizing, and adverse childhood experiences.",section,specific_aims,192.0,2959.0,414,3U01DK097779-12S1,LURN II: Enhanced Characterization of Patients with LUTS Using Biopsychosocial Approaches,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,3U01DK097779-12S1_chunk174,,,
"The development of type II diabetes (T2D) is strongly associated with obesity, and both are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Vascular dysfunction is an early event in developing cardiovascular disease in obese diabetic (OB-T2D) patients.

Therefore, we set our long-term goal to define molecular mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and corrective strategies that target these mechanisms, such as physical activity and weight loss.

We recently discovered that human adipose tissues release extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) that are efficiently captured by endothelial cells.

Adiposomes are known to carry bioactive cargos such as proteins and micro RNAs; however, their lipid content has not been studied, neither their ability to transfer their lipid cargo to endothelial cells.

In the current application, we propose investigating the role of adiposomes in communicating the unhealthy milieu, mainly dysregulated lipids, to endothelial cells in OB-T2D subjects.

On top of these lipid species that we propose to be carried by adiposomes are glycosphingolipids (GSLs).

GSLs originate from ceramide glycosylation, a chemical process that is upregulated in the presence of inflammation and high glucose levels.

Our preliminary findings showed that in endothelial cells, GSL-rich adiposomes disturb plasma membrane structure and subsequently induces endothelial dysfunction.

Moreover, we found preconditioning endothelial cells with high shear stress (which is an exercise mimetic) protected endothelial cells from the detrimental effects caused by adiposomes.

Therefore, our central hypothesis is that adipose tissues in OB-T2D patients release GSL-loaded adiposomes that induce vascular endothelial dysfunction.",results,semantic_chunk,,,238,5R01HL161386-03,Role of Adiposomes in Diabetes-Associated Endothelial Dysfunction and Restorative Effects of Exercise and Metabolic Surgery,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01HL161386-03_chunk175,False,False,False
"We propose that exercise and weight loss interventions (bariatric surgery) will restore adipose tissue homeostasis, reduce GSL-loaded adiposomes, and subsequently alleviate vascular risk in OB-T2D patients.

We will test our hypotheses by pursuing the following Aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of GSL-rich adiposomes in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in OB- T2D adults; Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of exercise training in reducing adiposome-mediated effects on vascular function; and Aim 3: Examine changes in adiposome/caveolae axis following metabolic surgery and their association with vascular function.

This study will improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological underpinning of adiposome production, packaging, and role in inducing ED under conditions of obesity and T2D.

It will also identify adiposomes and the proposed mechanisms of their interaction with endothelial cells as novel therapeutic targets for improving vascular function in OB-T2D individuals.

Once these pathways are elucidated, strategies for targeting them can be advanced, leading to an improved therapeutic management of T2D-related cardiovascular disease.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,160,5R01HL161386-03,Role of Adiposomes in Diabetes-Associated Endothelial Dysfunction and Restorative Effects of Exercise and Metabolic Surgery,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01HL161386-03_chunk176,False,False,True

Our central hypothesis is that the inflammatory response to threat signals such as the initial breaching of the endothelial plasma membrane by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rapid release of mitochondrial DNA by the injured mitochondria into the cytosol massively and acutely amplifies the inflammatory response and thus serves as essential feed-forward mechanisms for progression of acute lung injury (ALI).

In Aim 2, we will define another crucial amplification mechanism, the potentially important role of Gasdermin D-mediated mitochondrial (mt) membrane pore formation and the release of mtDNA, which may also catastrophically amplifiy lung injury via activation of Type I interferon signaling.

"Visceral obesity associates with insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, which are major risk factors for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Although the cellular hallmark of obesity is neutral lipid expansion in adipocytes, adipose tissue of obese mice and humans also accumulate macrophages and other leukocytes.

It is well accepted that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) play a critical role in systemic insulin resistance, suggesting that inflammatory mediators produced by ATMs are important factors linking excess fat mass to insulin sensitivity, glucose intolerance, and increased atherosclerotic risk.

Understanding the mechanistic basis of the pro-inflammatory ATM phenotype and ATM function is required to devise new strategies for attenuating inflammation in metabolic disease.

Pro-inflammatory pathways in ATMs are commonly attributed to classical activation (exposure to bacteria, M1), establishing molecular links between innate immunity and metabolic dysfunction.

Recent studies, including work from our lab, suggest that M1 activation fails to accurately represent the complex phenotype of ATMs in vivo.

We have shown that ATMs in obese adipose tissue from humans and mice adopt a unique ‘metabolically activated’ (MMe) phenotype that is distinct from the M1 phenotype.

Inhibiting MMe activation of macrophages in vivo, attenuates ATM inflammation and improved glucose tolerance in mice.

Moreover, the abundance of MMe-like ATMs in visceral fat is positively correlated with insulin resistance in patients controlled for adiposity.

These findings underscore the pathophysiological importance of MMe macrophages in mice and humans.

Although MMe and M1 macrophages are both characterized by increased expression of NFkB-induced inflammatory cytokines (ie.",results,semantic_chunk,,,248,5R01DK102960-09,'Metabolically Activated' Macrophages in Obesity and Insulin Resistance,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01DK102960-09_chunk182,False,False,False
"Tnfa, Il1b, Il6), our preliminary studies demonstrate that the upstream signaling cascades driving NFkB activation are remarkably distinct.

We provide evidence for a novel fatty acid-driven, ROS-dependent, tyrosine-kinase mediated, pro-inflammatory signaling cascade in MMe macrophages.

Targeting this ‘metabolically activated NFkB’ (Me-NFkB) pathway at any point selectively attenuates inflammatory cytokine expression by MMe macrophages.

Our work has positioned us to test the innovative hypothesis that this Me-NFkB pathway promotes ATM inflammation and insulin resistance during obesity but is dispensable for inflammation required for host defense during infection.

Specifically, we plan to 1) Delineate the Me-NFkB pathway that drives inflammation in MMe macrophages, and 2) Determine if targeting the Me-NFkB pathway improves insulin sensitivity in mice.

Overall, our proposed studies aim to demonstrate that macrophage inflammation in metabolic disease can be attenuated without blocking these same cytokines in bacterial infection, a conceptual milestone that may lead to an improved anti-inflammatory strategy in the clinic.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,152,5R01DK102960-09,'Metabolically Activated' Macrophages in Obesity and Insulin Resistance,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01DK102960-09_chunk183,False,False,True

"Background: Cells experience a wide array of environmental stresses, and must be able to sense and respond to changes in order to survive. The sensing process which occurs depends on the stress itself, and we have identified over 150 heat-sensitive proteins in S. cerevisiae which exhibit biomolecular condensation after temperature increase. Within this group, a conserved set of GTPases displays significant aggregation without the requirement of any other cellular components, opening up the possibility that these proteins have the ability to sense heat shock. Further, this set of proteins is connected to two fundamental functional responses which occur under heat stress -- transcriptional upregulation of heat shock genes and shutoff of ribosome biogenesis. Proteins that are highly sensitive to heat may act as long-unidentified sensors upstream of massive functional changes within the cell, and serve as heat sensing candidates for this proposal.

"A large fraction of the intestinal commensal microbiota is coated with IgA antibodies in homeostatic conditions, but the strategy and the mechanisms deployed to confront the immense diversity of bacterial antigens have remained elusive. Converging studies indicate that homeostatic IgA responses employ a highly polyreactive repertoire to bind broad but distinct subsets of microbiota. These antibody responses develop in the presence of limited T cell help, with low rate of somatic mutations and little affinity maturation. This new perspective contrasts with the classical paradigm of T cell-dependent, high-affinity antibody responses elicited by mucosal pathobionts, pathogens and vaccines, and provides a simple immunological solution to the challenge of microbiota antigenic complexity. It also raises several fundamental issues, including how polyreactive specificities are generated and selected in the IgA repertoire, and how they coexist or overlap with other immune responses during homeostasis and disease. This project addresses these issues by (i) generating polyreactive IgA knock-in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to (ii) understand the development and differentiation of polyreactive IgA precursor B cells and (iii) to study the function of polyreactive IgA at the clonal level in the context of intestinal and extraintestinal challenges.

"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Cells assemble functionally diverse actin cytoskeleton networks with distinct architectures and dynamics to drive fundamental processes such as polarization, endocytosis, motility and division. The specific characteristics of different actin filament networks (actin filament density, organization and dynamics) are determined through the coordination action of specific sets of actin binding proteins (ABPs) with complementary binding properties. Most investigations primarily focus on individual F-actin networks. However, this provides limited overall understanding of F-actin network organization and function because cells typically assemble and use multiple F-actin networks simultaneously within the same cytoplasm. Consequently, F-actin networks must self-organize from a common pool of shared actin monomers and overlapping sets of ABPs. We have predicted that there are important interactions (cross talk) between networks that are critical for their form and function. Our long-term goal is to discover the direct and indirect interactions between self-organized F-actin networks, which are critical for establishing their unique identities and functions within a common cytoplasm, and to determine the underlying molecular mechanistic principles that govern these interactions. We are investigating two major actin cytoskeleton self-organization questions. The first is to determine the mechanisms by which the size and density of F-actin networks are regulated by competition for a limiting amount of actin monomers (Aim I). Although unassembled G-actin was not thought to be limiting, we systematically showed that competition for G-actin helps control the size and density of competitive F-actin networks in fission yeast, and that the actin monomer protein profilin plays a major role in regulating competition for limiting G-actin. Our goal is to determine the underlying mechanism by which profilin and other ABPs contribute to the proper distribution of G-actin between functionally diverse actin cytoskeleton networks. The second is to determine how diverse F-actin networks acquire the specific set of ABPs whose complementary biochemical activities help define their form and function (Aim II). We will investigate the underlying intrinsic molecular mechanisms by which ABPs self-sort to particular F-actin networks within a common cytoplasm, including (1) the contribution of competition and cooperation between ABPs for associating with actin filaments, and (2) whether actin assembly factors initiate self-sorting by biasing the association of particular ABPs.",section,abstract,0.0,2610.0,358,5R01GM079265-13,Actin Cytoskeleton Network Self-Organization,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01GM079265-13_chunk197,,,

"methodologies and reagents based on phage display generated synthetic antibodies (sABs). Customize phage display selection strategies enable generation of sABs endowed with special properties, for instance, conformation and regio-specificity.

While sABs have demonstrated efficacy as crystallization chaperones, their use in cryo-EM as powerful fiducial marks, adding 50 kDa to the particle and their ability to trap conformation states, is especially impactful in studies linking conformational transitions and function. This is particularly relevant for smaller membrane proteins (< 50 kDa), which include ion channels transporters and receptors.

"We have discovered a new mechanism for inflammation on the ocular surface.

First, we discovered the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) on the ocular surface of dry eye disease (DED) patients and subsequently, the presence of citrullinated proteins and anti- citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs).

ACPAs not only cause ocular surface disease, but also stimulate formation of NETs, thus creating a self-perpetuating cycle of chronic inflammation on the ocular surface.

We present an innovative pathophysiological concept: DED is characterized by breach of self-tolerance towards citrullinated antigens with generation of autoantibodies (ACPAs) and NETs could represent a source of citrullinated antigens fueling the ACPA autoimmune response over the ocular surface.

We performed a first-in-human pilot clinical trial and showed that ocular surface immune globulin (OSIG) eye drops, formulated from pooled human immune globulin products (IVIG), were safe and efficacious in treating DED patients.

Our findings shift the current paradigm that focuses on T-cell mediated inflammation as central to the pathophysiology of DED to also include autoimmune inflammation that is driven by post- translational modifications in self-proteins (citrullination) and autoantibodies (ACPAs).

"approach to specifically focus on the transcriptional regulation of MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes. The goal of this proposal is to uncover conserved, gene regulatory mechanisms that establish during development, and maintain throughout life, the expression of MN subtype-specific terminal features. To this end, this proposal combines the strengths of two model organisms: the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse Mus musculus. By studying how C. elegans ventral nerve cord (VNC) MNs acquire their subtype-specific features, we discovered a gene regulatory mechanism that involves the intersectional activity of highly conserved transcription factors. We found that the transcription factor UNC-3 induces and maintains the expression of terminal identity genes in all VNC MN subtypes. However, UNC-3 does not act alone. It requires co-factors in the form of Hox proteins that act synergistically with UNC-3 to activate expression of terminal identity genes in distinct MN subtypes along the anterior-posterior axis of the VNC. We observed Hox expression in developing and adult MNs, suggesting that Hox proteins, similar to UNC-3, not only induce, but also maintain expression of terminal identity genes. The unpublished data in this application indicate that Hox proteins, in mice, also control expression of terminal identity genes in spinal MNs, suggesting evolutionary conservation of our C. elegans findings. This proposal aims to uncover the function of Hox proteins in adult C. elegans MNs (Aim 1), decipher the gene regulatory mechanisms downstream of Hox in C. elegans MNs (Aim 2), and test the hypothesis that a mouse Hox protein (Hoxc8), similar to its C. elegans orthologs, is required to induce and maintain expression of terminal identity genes in MNs of the brachial spinal cord (Aim 3).

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Since December 2019, coordinated research efforts have provided a wealth of critical data that have enhanced our ability to diagnose and treat COVID-19.

To date, however, much of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remain elusive.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains nine independent open reading frames (ORFs) coding for proteins that are not essential for viral replication but seem to exert important functions in modulating host antiviral immunity.

Of these accessory proteins, the ORF8 protein stands out for its unique characteristics.

ORF8 is a highly variable protein among SARS-related CoVs.

ORF8 also appears to be involved in a network of host-pathogen interactions inside infected cells: ORF8 impairs immune pathways such as antigen presentation, interferon type I, and nuclear factor-kB, as well as possibly activate growth pathways.

A central question is how ORF8 mediates interactions with multiple host protein targets.

Towards this goal, we are investigating ORF8 interaction with major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules.

It was shown recently that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 suppresses CD8+ T cell responses by downregulating MHC I molecules, both in vitro and in vivo.

We hypothesize that ORF8 suppresses surface expression of HLA-A and HLA-B molecules to protect infected cells from recognition by CD8+ T cells, but spares HLA-C and HLA-E to avoid activation of natural killer (NK) cells.",results,semantic_chunk,,,234,1R21AI173863-01,Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2: the role of HLA class I,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,1R21AI173863-01_chunk214,False,False,False
"The possibility that ORF8 displays a locus specificity toward MHC I would provide a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 to walk a fine line between adaptive and innate immunity.

Specifically, we will undertake an analysis of interactions between ORF8 and MHC I by using a panel of HLA- A, -B, -C, and -E molecules, and also determine if ORF8 selectively downregulates MHC I in relevant cell systems (Aim 1).

We will extend these studies to ORF8 variants that have been positively selected during the course of the pandemic and evaluate if and how these mutations affect MHC I binding and downregulation (Aim 2).

The successful completion of these Aims is expected to uncover unknown features of ORF8 and elucidate its role in suppressing antigen presentation, as well as inform us on the selective pressure that MHC I exerts on SARS-CoV-2.

The immediate and long-term impact of our proposed research is high.

This is the first study that: (1) characterizes molecular interaction of ORF8 with a host protein; and (2) evaluates clinically relevant ORF8 variants.

By studying the immune interactions underlying ORF8-mediated downregulation of MHC I, we will increase our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 derails cellular immunity.

Importantly, our study will stimulate similar investigations of other ORF8-interactors, providing novel opportunities for the development of therapeutics directed against ORF8 or its host targets.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,219,1R21AI173863-01,Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2: the role of HLA class I,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,1R21AI173863-01_chunk215,False,False,True

"The prevalence of food allergy has experienced an unprecedented increase in Western societies, rising by as much as 20% in a recent ten-year period.

We have previously described a role for mucosa- associated commensal bacteria in protection from allergic sensitization in mice.

To understand how the microbiota regulates allergic disease in humans, we colonized germ free mice with human bacteria from the feces of healthy or cow’s milk allergic (CMA) infants.

Our data shows that colonization with bacteria derived from healthy human infant feces is sufficient to protect mice against sensitization to the cow’s milk allergen b-lactoglobulin (BLG), whereas colonization with feces from human CMA infants fails to protect.

Correlation of ileal OTUs with DEGs in the ileum of healthy-colonized mice identified a Clostridial species, Anaerostipes caccae, that protected against an allergic response to food.

"results suggest that dynein and the Ndc80 complex synergize for efficient chromosome capture and for stabilizing kMT attachments during metaphase, but the mechanism for this coordination is unclear. The centromere-distal region of the Ndc80 complex at the N-terminal domain of the Hec1 subunit has been identified as the MT-binding site required to stabilize kMT attachments. Phosphorylation of this region by Aurora B kinase negatively regulates the strength of kMT attachments. Our work has discovered that in addition to the N-terminal domain, the more internal loop domain has a major role in attachment.

"Heart failure (HF) is a major health epidemic in developed countries, however, its underlying pathology is not well characterized.

Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a tandem zinc finger protein that binds to AU-rich elements (ARE) in the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA molecules, and induces their degradation.

Global TTP knockout (KO) mice display systemic inflammation, since TNFα mRNA is normally degraded by TTP, and deletion of TTP leads to elevated TNFα levels.

Thus, very few studies have assessed the role of TTP in metabolism despite its original discovery as an insulin-inducible gene, and genetic studies linking TTP to metabolic syndrome.

We are addressing this fundamental gap in knowledge, and our strong preliminary data suggest critical activities by TTP in cardiac metabolism and the development of HF.

Specifically, we have shown that TTP inhibits fatty acid (FA) and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism (independent of its effects on inflammation), and reduces the mRNA levels of key proteins in these processes, i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and branched-chain α–ketoacid acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC)-E2 subunits.

The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TTP inhibits cardiac FA and BCAA metabolism by binding to and degrading PPARα and BCKDC-E2 mRNAs, and that TTP exacerbates the development of HF by impairing FA and BCAA metabolism.

In Aim 1, we will assess whether TTP inhibits cardiac FA metabolism by binding to PPARα mRNA and promoting its degradation.",results,semantic_chunk,,,230,5R01HL155953-03,Role of mRNA-binding protein tristetraprolin in cardiac mRNA regulation and the development of heart failure,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01HL155953-03_chunk228,False,False,False
"We will assess whether TTP binds to PPARα mRNA by performing RNA co-immunopreciptation (co-IP) and deletion studies of PPARα 3’-UTR AREs.

We will also measure FA uptake and metabolism in the hearts from cardiac-specific TTP KO (csTTP-KO) mice, and will determine whether these changes are through PPARα using TTP/PPARα double KO mice.

In Aim 2, we will determine whether TTP decreases BCAA catabolism through binding and degradation of BCKDC-E2 mRNA.

We will first determine whether TTP binds BCKDC-E2 mRNA by performing RNA co-IP and deletion studies on BCKDC-E2 3’-UTR AREs.

We will also measure BCAA levels and BCKDC activity in heart tissue from csTTP-KO mice.

To demonstrate whether the reduction in BCAA catabolism with TTP KO is through BCKDC-E2, we will perform similar studies with knockdown of TTP and BCKDC-E2.

In Aim 3, we will determine whether TTP has detrimental effects on the heart under stress conditions, and whether this depends upon impaired FA and BCAA metabolism.

We will subject csTTP-KO mice to pressure overload and ischemia, then assess their cardiac function and metabolism.

To determine the role of PPARα and BCKDC in this process, we will use csTTP/PPARα double KO mice and will cross csTTP-KO with protein phosphatase 2Cm KO mice (which have reduced BCKDC activity), and assess cardiac response to stress.

"background. Scn1a+/- mice on the resistant 129 strain (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrast, Scn1a+/- mice on a [129xB6]F1 strain (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality, with 50% dying by 1 month of age. Strain-dependent differences are also evident at the level of neuron subtypes. GABAergic interneurons isolated from the susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased sodium current density compared to wildtype littermates, while sodium current density is preserved in interneurons isolated from 129.Scn1a+/- relative to wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for the loss of Nav1.1, while F1 interneurons do not. Based on the strain-dependent difference in phenotypes at the whole animal and cellular levels, we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severity due to differences in compensatory capacity among neuronal subtypes in the context of Scn1a heterozygous deletion. We previously mapped several Dravet survival modifier (Dsm) loci that influence premature lethality of Scn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal, we will address our hypothesis in three aims.

"Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) leaders across the country have called for more effective ways to train K-12 teachers in pedagogy aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).

While NGSS holds promise as an engaging way for students to build authentic science skills and conceptual knowledge, implementation is limited by the degree to which teachers can be trained in new, significant pedagogical shifts.

This is especially true for K-5 teachers who have low confidence teaching science and, accordingly, devote little time to science instruction.

This problem is especially acute in urban schools with insufficient resources to meet NGSS training needs.

This threatens NGSS coherence across grade levels.

We must develop effective, efficient NGSS training models if we are to realize our long-term goal of a well-trained, diverse STEM and healthcare workforce.

Functionally independent, ‘cognitively normal’ adults ages 55-74 (N=900) were recruited from community primary care practices in Chicago. Participants have completed comprehensive cognitive, psychological, social, behavioral, and functional health assessments every 3 years (4 interviews; 2008-2018). The sample is diverse by race, socioeconomic status and medical morbidity; uncommon among cognitive aging studies. A 1st renewal award (LitCog II) examined changes in cognition, HL and SM skills over 6 years and their associations with physical and mental health. We found cognitive function to be strongly associated with HL; both decline together over time. Cognitive function and HL also determine older adults’ SM skills; all predict functional health status and its decline. A 2nd renewal (LitCog III) has allowed us to capture new health behaviors, chronic disease outcomes, and healthcare use from medical, pharmacy records a decade post-baseline. Cognitive function, HL and SM skills impact all of these outcomes. LitCog III is almost complete; 774 of 900 (86%) subjects are alive and available for further study. We now propose to conduct follow-up assessments 12 and 15 years post-baseline (LitCog IV).

"result in aneuploidy (incorrect chromosome number in the embryos), the leading known cause of miscarriages and birth defects in humans. Meiosis in females is especially error prone and this vulnerability has a profound impact on human health: it is estimated that 10-25% of human embryos are chromosomally abnormal, and the vast majority of these defects arise from problems with the female meiotic cells (called oocytes). However, despite the importance of female meiosis for successful reproduction and human health, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that act to ensure accurate chromosome partitioning in oocytes. Oocytes have some special features that necessitate the use of novel cell division mechanisms. Perhaps most significantly, oocytes lack centrosomes, which define and organize the spindle poles in other cell types; therefore, spindles in these cells are morphologically distinct. Using C. elegans as a model, we previously found that acentrosomal oocyte spindles have a surprising organization; chromosomes are ensheathed by microtubule bundles that run along their sides, making lateral contacts, instead of forming end-on kinetochore attachments. Moreover, we also defined new mechanisms that facilitate chromosome congression on these spindles, driven by movement of chromosomes along these lateral bundles. Therefore, our work has revealed a new strategy utilized by C. elegans oocytes for controlling chromosome dynamics during cell division. Building on these discoveries, the goals of the proposed work are to: 1) deepen our understanding of these unique mechanisms, and 2) identify factors that regulate them. An important component of this system is a complex of proteins that form a ring structure around the center of each chromosome pair (the “ring complex”).

"approach does not account for individual needs, nor can it realistically be implemented into survivorship care. mHealth tools (i.e. smartphone applications, Fitbits, text messages), are inexpensive and have demonstrated efficacy for increasing MVPA in other populations. Thus, they may be a more scalable, less resource-intensive strategy to increase MVPA in more survivors. The ability to integrate wearable MVPA monitor data into the electronic health record (EHR) further enhances the potential for a technology-supported MVPA intervention to be integrated into cancer care.

While a minimal intervention including the Fitbit integrated into the EHR (Fitbit+EHR) may be sufficient for some cancer survivors to increase their MVPA, others will need more support. Further, some survivors may need this additional support early on, while others may succeed early, but fail later when the MVPA goal increases.

"approaches to reduce FGF23-associated adverse outcomes in CKD are desperately needed but current therapies are suboptimal due to lack of understanding of the role of FGF23 peptides. In preliminary data we show that in addition to iFGF23, FGF23 peptides are secreted by bone and extraosseous sources, including erythroid cells, in CKD. We also show that these peptides display novel physiological functions. Cter-FGF23 peptides suppress the secretion of the hepatic iron regulatory hormone, hepcidin, leading to increased circulating iron. Nter-FGF23 peptides are not released in the circulation when FGF23 is expressed in bone, but in iron deficient animals and patients and mice with CKD, FGF23 production by erythroid cells contribute to increased circulating Nter-FGF23 levels. When elevated, Nter-FGF23 reduces the secretion of erythropoietin, inhibits erythropoiesis and induces left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). These observations support important new roles of FGF23 peptides, and a functional role for the coupled regulation of Fgf23 transcription and iFGF23 cleavage. In Aim 1, we will establish the physiological and pathological role of Cter-FGF23 peptides in iron metabolism. Using multiple genetic mouse models, we will delete and overexpress Fgf23 and Cter-Fgf23 in bone, to test whether Cter-FGF23 peptides generated from increased FGF23 cleavage, protect mice against overt hypoferremia by uniquely limiting hepcidin secretion in models of high (inflammation and iron overload) or low (iron deficiency) endogenous hepcidin and compare these effects to exogenous hepcidin administration. We will further test the therapeutic potential of genetic and pharmacologic Cter-FGF23 supplementation in two mouse models of CKD and assess the onset and development of iron deficiency anemia.

"resulting in deficient DA signaling, underpins the debilitating motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Among DA neurons, those located in ventral tier of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), are particularly vulnerable, compared to those in the dorsal tier of the SNc or ventral tegmental area (VTA). A mechanistic explanation of selective DA neuron vulnerability remains an important goal, that has been hampered in part by a lack of understanding of the intrinsic differences between DA neurons. We hypothesize that even within a single neuroanatomical cluster like the SNc, there exist DA subtypes with distinct developmental histories and intrinsic properties that may influence their vulnerability. Single cell expression profiling based DA neuron classification from our lab revealed the presence of a key SNc population defined by Sox6 and Aldh1a1 - this subtype was located in the ventral tier of the SNc, and was preferentially vulnerable in a toxin model of PD. Our preliminary data indicate that this population exists in human SNc, and is also selectively vulnerable in post-mortem PD samples. To interrogate the basis for selectively vulnerability in the SNc in depth, we next developed a set of intersectional genetic strategies, which strikingly defined a fault-line in the SNc defined by Sox6 expression, with Sox6+ cells being located ventrally and Sox6- cells forming the dorsal tier. Building on these studies, several key questions remain unanswered. Are dorsal and ventral SNc subtypes developmentally distinct? Do these neurons have different anatomical features and DA release characteristics? Is the size of arborizations of these neurons, a property linked to vulnerability, different? Are calcium fluxes and mitochondrial bioenergetic properties distinct? To answer these questions, in Aim 1, we will determine the origin of SNc neuron subtypes.

However, the potential of this technology can be immensely enhanced. We propose to develop and optimize a new class of spectroscopic super-resolution imaging tool, referred to as spectroscopic single-molecular localization microscope or sSMLM.

"resulting in resilience that is only `skin-deep.' Here we propose a project that will clarify why skin- deep resilience develops, when in development it emerges, and whether early-warning signs can be detected. We will recruit 450 African American youth from low-income families ages 14-19. They will be assessed at baseline and 1 and 2 years later, in the context of an accelerated longitudinal design (ALD). The first aim is to identify individual psychological and social network factors that contribute to skin-deep resilience, such as high levels of self-control that may promote academic success but have physiological costs, as well as a lack of belonging or experiences of discrimination with peers in academic environments among skin-deep resilient youth. The second aim is to create biological risk profiles that can function as early warning signs of developing health problems in African American youth. To that end, we will collect in-depth measures of stress hormone output, inflammatory activity, and epigenetic aging over a 2-year period, and test these markers' ability to predict subsequent cardiovascular risk, including metabolic syndrome (primary outcome) and flow- mediated vasodilation (an indicator of endothelial dysfunction; secondary outcome). The third aim is to determine when skin-deep resilience emerges and to characterize its developmental trajectory. To that end, we will use the accelerated longitudinal design to map skin-deep resilience, and its academic, psychosocial, and biological features across the high school and college years.

"methods how the pro-apoptotic isoform of this gene, ERRβ2, is processed. I found that the serine/arginine (SR) rich splicing factor SRSF6 plays a role in ERRβ2 production and that inhibition of Cdc-like kinases (CLKs, which phosphorylate SR proteins) with TG-003 in combination with the ERRβ synthetic agonist DY-131 potently inhibits TMZ-resistant GBM cells in vitro and in intracranial xenografts. The second (Aim 1.2) is a broader study of splicing inhibition and regulation in TMZ-resistant GBM. I found that TMZ decreases the phosphorylation (p) of SR proteins in TMZ-sensitive, but not TMZ-resistant models. This is accompanied by mis-localization of pSR proteins, and increased baseline levels of DNA damage. In TMZ- resistant GBM cells, the RNA binding protein EWS also mis-localizes and forms aggregates that are stabilized by tubulin. My working hypothesis is that because of the increased DNA damage in TMZ-resistant GBM, the DNA damage response becomes reprogrammed which causes splicing factors (like EWS and pSR proteins) to be displaced from their normal cellular compartments and poised for aberrant aggregation. Also, that this new splicing factor/DNA damage repair axis can be therapeutically targeted with novel splicing inhibitors. During the postdoctoral training period (Aim 2), I will address a key gap in our understanding of the GBM transcriptome: the role of non-coding RNAs, specifically the noncanonical back-spliced or circular RNAs (circRNAs). I propose to define the circRNA landscape of GBM, to determine the regulatory functions and to propose potential therapeutic applications of these abundant and dynamic regulators of splicing and transcription.

The RADAR study was launched in 2014 to provide critical insights into risk and protective factors for HIV and drug use, and to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of an effective strategy to end the epidemic.

RADAR is reflective of the US HIV epidemic; it focuses on the ages with the highest HIV incidence, has exceptional representation of minority HIV disparity groups (38% black, 30% Latino), and is located in Chicago, an urban epicenter of the HIV and drug epidemics (i.e., Cook County was 4th in HIV incidence-2017).

During our initial grant period, we were extremely productive in recruitment (N>1,200), retention (>80%), scientific outputs (40+ publications), training future scholars, and serving as a platform for innovative research (25+ connected studies; 7 concepts via NIDA C3PNO consortium).

YMSM account for nearly 70% of all new HIV diagnoses among adolescents and young adults each year in the U.S.

While all other risk groups have declining incidence, dramatic increases continue among YMSM of color.

In an era of evolving prevention and treatment options, YMSM still show insufficient PrEP utilization and fall off the HIV care cascade at high rates.

"For many years brain-computer interfaces (BCI's) have been explored as a means of restoring communication to patients with Locked-In Syndrome (LIS), a devastating and often irreversible neurological condition in which cognition is intact but nearly all motor output from the brain is interrupted, effectively cutting off communication with the outside world.

To date non-invasive BCI's (e.g.

EEG) have had inadequate signal fidelity and spatial resolution, while invasive BCI's using microelectrode arrays in hand motor cortex have delivered cursor and multi-joint robotic control in controlled settings, but have been difficult to learn and have required frequent retraining of decoding models, due to instabilities in the microelectrode-tissue interface.

High-density electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings have been recently used by our team (JHU and University of Utrecht) and by others for real-time detection and classification of a variety of different upper limb movements and speech components.

ECoG has sufficient spatial-temporal resolution and signal quality to decode the broadband high-gamma (~60-200 Hz) responses of native cortical representations for upper limb movements and speech.

Speech representations are spatially distributed over several square centimeters, ideally suited for electrocorticography (ECoG), but impractical for MEA's.

"methods for large-scale monitoring of neural activity” is directly 3 addressed by this application. The Neuropixels probe (Jun et al., Nature 2017) demonstrated that a high 4 channel count Si shank with continuous, dense, programmable sites yielded a large capacity increase in 5 monitoring of neural activity (100's vs. 10's of units for typical devices). Neuropixels NXT will increase 6 substantially the utility of that high capacity shank by optimizing and deploying a new platform technology for 7 neural recording, direct-to-digital. Neuropixels, while revolutionary over prior art, has an integrated probe 8 “base” for amplification and digitization and a digital interface board (head stage) that both reside above the 9 brain. Together, the crowding of these components above the brain limits the number of shanks that can be 10 used in one experimental animal. Follow-on projects are already underway to relieve this crowding and weight 11 such that we expect 2 Neuropixels probes (768 channels of recording capacity) could be used on a freely 12 moving, tethered mouse. While this represents a substantial improvement, it remains far short of the brain wide 13 recording that satisfies the above stated ambition to “produce a dynamic picture of the functioning brain”. 14 Building on the demonstrated performance of the Neuropixels shank, we propose to optimize the base 15 electronics so that a probe with ~768 channels would have a base of < 5mm2 (an 18x shrinkage of the base 16 area per channel compared to Neuropixels, and 6x shrinkage compared to Neuropixels 2.0), require no extra 17 digital interface board (head stage), and instead have a 6-conductor micro-cable between the probe and a high 18 speed data hub for digital transmission that can handle multiple probes simultaneously. This smaller probe 19 base will allow it to be made narrow so that each probe will act as a “unit shank” that can be tiled side-to-side 20 into a “comb”, and combs stacked into 2 dimensional arrays of shanks, yielding dense 3 dimensional arrays of 21 programmable recording sites.

"Until and unless we better understand and prevent spillovers of bat-borne viruses into intermediate hosts and humans, we will be severely limited in our ability to stop pandemics.

Henipaviruses are bat-borne, RNA viruses that spillover through this route.

Nearly half of all reported human henipavirus infections have been associated with contact with sick domesticated animals, though our understanding of drivers of henipavirus spillovers and specific transmission pathways remains severely limited.

Building on preliminary data about bat, domesticated animal and human infections, this multidisciplinary study integrates epidemiology, ecology, and anthropology to identify spillover pathways for henipaviruses into domesticated animals in Bangladesh and the risk they pose to human health.

Our first aim is to identify drivers of henipavirus spillovers into domesticated animals in Faridpur, Bangladesh.

We will use multiplex pan-henipavirus assays to identify infections in Pteropus medius bats and domesticated animals living nearby this roost through cross-sectional and prospective studies.

Combined with intensive studies of bat-domesticated animal interactions and weather data, we will build statistical models to identify the relative contribution of each of these factors.

Fourth, the insulin and IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathways, the key regulators of nutrient sensing, are the most conserved aging controlling pathway in evolution. IGF-1 and many IIS downstream targets, such as Pten/PI3K, Akt, and mTor, are all important regulators of optic nerve regeneration.

Lastly, recent findings indicated that cellular reprogramming process can reverse aging and rejuvenate the cells. Importantly, manipulations of several reprogramming factors, such as KLF4 and Lin28, have been shown to promote optic nerve regeneration.

"significance of respiratory failure occurring after BMT was recently underscored by a June 2018 NIH workshop specifically convened to identify clinical challenges and scientific knowledge gaps regarding pulmonary dysfunction after BMT in pediatric patients. Hence, the development of novel strategies that reduce the incidence and severity of pulmonary dysfunction after allo-BMT remains a significant unmet need. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a frequently fatal form of lung injury occurring after BMT. Progress has been made to understand the mechanisms responsible for IPS; the Cooke lab discovered that TNFα contributes directly to vascular endothelial cell (EC) injury and regulates the subsequent influx of donor cells into the lung. These insights lead to several clinical trials testing the effects of etanercept (a dimeric TNFα binding protein) in BMT-recipients with IPS. While successful, not all patients respond to etanercept revealing a critical need for continued research. Proteomic evaluation of plasma sample revealed striking similarities between human and experimental IPS and identified protein candidates that associate with EC injury and disease onset. Additional studies revealed a here-to-fore unknown association between IPS and the protein angiopoietin (Ang)-2. Ang-1 and Ang-2 are peptide ligands for the receptor tyrosine kinase, Tie-2 and represent an agonist / antagonist pair that regulate EC integrity. Moreover, Ang-2 sensitizes ECs to TNFα and regulates TNFα-induced adhesion molecule expression. Hence a significant body of pre-clinical and clinical data provides the basis for the following central hypothesis: During inflammation early after allo-BMT, the Ang1:Ang2 pathways regulate cytokine-mediated EC activation and integrity, increased adhesion molecule expression, and development of IPS. Pertinent to this application, EC damage and dysfunction is a common-thread among several BMT-related complications including IPS, graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver all of which contribute to MODS after BMT. Independent biomarker data also suggest that biologic pathways contributing to EC injury and leak during IPS are likely operative during the development of GVHD and VOD as well. The translational research potential of this application is therefore significant: Proposed experiments will enhance our understanding of how inflammation after transplant contributes to vascular EC injury and organ dysfunction with great potential to reduce the risk and severity of MODS in pediatric BMT recipients and thereby improve outcomes and broaden the utility of this powerful form of cellular therapy to children in need.",section,significance,527.0,3228.0,382,5R01HD100485-05,Inflammatory mechanisms responsible for the development of multiple organ dysfunction in pediatric patients following allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (BMT).,2024,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01HD100485-05_chunk341,,,

IBD is a chronic condition that negatively impacts patient quality of life and is associated with a high public health burden. There is no cure for IBD and a large percentage of affected individuals are unresponsive to all available treatments. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) is zinc metallopeptidase that is highly overexpressed in the two main subtypes of IBD: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The promise of GCPII as a therapeutic target in IBD has been demonstrated in multiple independent preclinical studies, which have shown that small molecule GCPII inhibitors have significant anti-colitis activity in three mechanistically-distinct mouse models. While it is apparent that GCPII upregulation is relevant in both human and mouse IBD, knowledge gaps exist regarding its function in disease. This K01 SERCA research will yield critical new data relevant to the biology of GCPII in IBD. Specifically, in Aim #1 GCPII expression will be defined in normal and IBD-affected gastrointestinal tissues of human and mouse IBD. In Aim #2, a novel knock-in mouse will be generated that overexpresses human GCPII in the ileum and colon, followed by longitudinal characterization of barrier function, gastrointestinal inflammation, microbiome composition and visceral pain response. It is hypothesized that the localization of GCPII overexpression will be conserved in human and mouse IBD and that adult mice with forced ileum and colon GCPII overexpression will spontaneously develop colitis.

"Project Summary Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue caused by mutations in the fibrillin- 1(FBN1) gene. These mutations cause increased vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) apoptosis, increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, excessive elastin degeneration and collagen overexpression; weakening the vascular architecture, impair hemodynamic regulation, and ultimately leading to severe vascular complications. Primary cells, tissue explants, and transgenic mouse models suffer from insufficiencies that inhibit development of novel insights into disease pathogenesis or potential therapeutics; warranting new modeling platforms. Recent advances in biomaterials have generated vascular grafts that mimic properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the natural vasculature. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are an ideal, patient specific renewable cell source that provides an avenue to study how genetic diseases effect cell mechanobiology, signaling and function to better development therapeutics. Here, using a natural fibrin-based vascular graft and hiPSCs from patients with Marfan Syndrome, we aim to: (1) fully characterized both ECs and contractile vSMCs from hiPSCs derived from Marfan patients, (2) study the responses of hiPSC-ECs to shear force and hiPSC-vSMCs to circumferential strain, (3) study the impacts of mechanical forces (i.e. shear force and circumferential strain) and paracrine signaling in a co-culture model, specifically reactive oxygen species(ROS), on vSMC phenotype and rate of graft degradation using the fibrin-based vascular graft.

"PROJECT ABSTRACT Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, affect 1 in 200 Americans. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapies remain the cornerstone of therapy for patients with IBD, but approximately 40% of patients will experience primary or secondary loss of response, and “anti- TNF-experienced” patients are less likely to respond to all subsequent therapies in current clinical practice. Single-cell RNA sequencing has uncovered key cellular signatures associated with anti-TNF refractoriness that strongly implicate signaling between inflammatory macrophages and activated fibroblasts. There remains a major gap in our understanding of the patient-specific factors that predispose to this aberrant macrophage- fibroblast activation, how it links to anti-TNF unresponsiveness, and the potential to modulate it to change to disease course and treatment response. Our work has focused on the functional implications of a pathogenic variant in a metal transporter, ZIP8 A391T, that dysregulates manganese homeostasis and is associated with complicated (stricturing and penetrating) Crohn’s disease. In studying ZIP8 391-Thr in a mouse model (Zip8 393T-knock-in (KI)), we have shown increased susceptibility to colitis, but even more interestingly, we have observed enhanced fibrosis. These mice also exhibit marked induction of Il-11, a pro-inflammatory and pro- fibrotic cytokine that is a hallmark of aberrant signaling between inflammatory macrophages and activated fibroblasts in patients with Crohn’s disease – particularly anti-TNF refractory disease. We therefore hypothesize that study of aberrant macrophage-fibroblast signaling is a key feature of disease pathogenesis in the Zip8 393T-KI mice. Establishing the underlying disease mechanisms are important because (1) up to 25% of patients with Crohn’s disease carry ZIP8 391-Thr in some populations and (2) the Zip8 393T-KI could serve as a novel translational model for mechanistic studies, particularly related to anti-TNF non-response. We will study this hypothesis in two aims: In Aim 1, we will determine if Zip8 393T-KI perturbs macrophage innate immune responses; in Aim 2, we will compare fibroblast activation induced by Zip8 393T-KI vs. WT Zip8 macrophages. The long-term goal is to establish if ZIP8 391-Thr genotype has clinical implications for the prevention of and treatment of patients with Crohn’s disease and use study of ZIP8 391-Thr-related pathology as key opportunity to elucidate the role of Mn homeostasis in human disease. This R03 application builds from a K08 that established the altered Mn homeostasis and fibroinflammatory phenotype in colitis in Zip8 393T-KI mice.

"PROJECT ABSTRACT Clonal hematopoiesis is acquired with aging, and in some cases, precedes the onset of both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders. However, the genetic drivers that underlie the evolution of clonal hematopoiesis and the subsequent disease risk remain poorly understood. This proposal builds on generated evidence showing that telomere length, a genetic and clinically available biomarker, predisposes to clonal hematopoiesis in Mendelian syndromes. We have also found evidence for distinct clonal hematopoiesis mutations that appear to differentially predispose to hypoplastic and myeloproliferative phenotypes. In this application, we will examine the role of telomere length in driving clonal evolution with aging in well- characterized cohorts including a Baltimore-based cohort of community-based women with a large African American subset. Additionally, we will also examine the onset and prevalence of a novel clonal hematopoiesis mutation in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene that appears to be protective against myeloid malignancies. This K08 grant application is supported by outstanding mentors and in a strong translational environment at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine with a detailed mentorship and training plan that focuses on genetic epidemiology and computational biology skills.

"End-stage liver disease is common in HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals due to co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Liver transplant (LT) in HIV+ individuals provides a clear survival benefit and outcomes will improve further with direct-acting antivirals for HCV.

There is already a severe organ shortage, with long waiting times, and a higher waitlist mortality for HIV+ individuals in particular, and the need for LT in HIV+ individuals is expected to grow.

Organs from HIV+ deceased donors (HIV D+) are a unique resource for HIV+ transplant candidates.

By expanding the donor pool, use of organs from HIV D+ could have a significant public health impact and decrease wait times for all individuals on the waitlist.

This motivated the Congressional HOPE (HIV Organ Policy Equity) Act which now allows HIV D+ transplants for HIV+ recipients (R+) under research protocols.

Potential risks of HIV D+/R+ transplants include complications related to donor-to-recipient HIV superinfection (HIV-SI), increased organ rejection rates, and accelerated liver fibrosis and/or steatosis after transplant due to viral hepatitis or metabolic liver disease.

Aim 2 will compare the incidence of liver disease including HCV- and HBV-related fibrosis and liver steatosis.

"approaches if we want to do more than provide incremental increases in patient survival and combat this emerging highly-aggressive lethal phenotype. Tumor- infiltrating fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-positive cells (i.e. MSCs, CAFs, and TAMs) are recognized as key architects of the pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to tumor progression. This is in part through their production of energy-rich nutrients and metabolic intermediates that the cancer cells “parasitize” from the extracellular fluid to fuel tumor growth and progression. These observations suggest that a FAP-targeted therapy could provide an AR-independent multi-faceted anti-tumor assault by simultaneously disrupting the parasitic dependence on the tumor stroma and eliminating multiple immunosuppressive cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To accomplish this goal, we have synthesized an orally-available small molecule FAP-activated mitochondrial protoxin based on niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic that uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with nanomolar potency in a cell cycle-independent manner, making it an ideal warhead for FAP+ stromal cells with a low proliferative index. This proposal is innovative from conceptual and technical perspectives: 1) multiple tumor-infiltrating FAP+ cells in the TME are selectively and simultaneously targeted to overcome the immune barrier and disrupt the “parasitic cycle” fueling tumor growth; 2) a first-in-class enzymatically-activated lipophilic mitochondrial protoxin designed to increase the therapeutic index of an FDA-approved drug while sparing toxicity to surrounding healthy tissue is synthesized and characterized; 3) FAP expression patterns in a unique series of human prostate tissues, lymph nodes, and metastases as a function of malignancy and treatment status are assessed to identify clinical states most likely to benefit from FAP-targeted therapy; and 4) efficacy, toxicity, and specificity are evaluated using a novel series of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and syngeneic models that recapitulate key clinical features of human PCa in order to delineate biologically-relevant immune-independent and –dependent mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor response. Furthermore, this strategy combines agents that have been individually tested in patients, which significantly bolsters potential for near-term patient benefit.

This new application focuses on studying a newly discovered neuronal specific abundant proteasome complex and its link to neuronal function in health and aging related neurodegenerative disease.

Based on extensive original findings, our central hypothesis is that neuronal activity promotes the degradation of newly synthesized proteins through a transmembrane-like proteasome complex in order to rapidly generate biologically meaningful peptides that are critical for normal nervous system function and appear protective against neurodegenerative processes.

The rationale for the proposed research is that nothing is known about this new form of protein homeostasis and further understanding is critical in providing vital insight into neuronal functions mediated by protein degradation.

Given the critical importance of protein degradation to human health, the long-range objective of the proposed research is to understand the regulation and function of this degradation program and to apply this knowledge to the detection and eventual treatment of cognitive disorders.

"Nearly 25% of Americans age 65+ report serious mobility problems.

Mobility impairments decrease quality of life and predict increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality.

However, the contribution of age-related brain changes to mobility impairments is not well understood.

F99 work will examine how cortical inhibitory function relates to gait and balance declines with aging.

K00 work will examine the same questions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and test exercise as an intervention to improve cortical inhibitory function.

The sponsor's (Dr.

Rachael Seidler) past work supports the novel hypothesis that declines in cortical inhibitory processes at least partially underlie motor impairments with aging.

For Aim 1 (F99), the candidate is collecting two measures of lower limb cortical inhibition in 30 young and 30 older adults: 1) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 2) transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced cortical silent period.

GABA-edited MRS provides a measure of GABA neurotransmitter concentration, while cortical silent periods provide a measure of functional cortical inhibition during muscle activity.

The F99 work addresses whether these two measures of cortical inhibition are reduced in older age (Aim 1a) and whether cortical inhibition relates to individual differences in gait (Aim 1b) and balance (Aim 1c).

Mobility is often more impaired in MCI than in healthy aging.

Thus, for Aim 2 (K00), the candidate will work with Dr.

Kirk Erickson to test whether cortical inhibition is reduced in MCI compared to healthy aging (Aim 2a) and if cortical inhibition relates to gait and balance in MCI (Aim 2b).

Given relationships between cortical inhibition and motor control in healthy adults, it is feasible that cortical inhibition changes could also relate to mobility declines in MCI.

Understanding neurotransmitter systems involved in mobility declines is important for development of interventions.

Thus, the candidate will test whether aerobic exercise influences cortical inhibition in aging and MCI (Aim 2c).

Past work demonstrated effects of exercise on cortical inhibition in young adults, but this has yet to be tested in aging or MCI.

This work directly contributes to the NIA's major goals of preserving mobility in aging and studying brain changes with MCI.

These membranes closely mimic areas of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) and choriocapillaris loss.

I have also observed Müller cells anterior to drusen expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and appearing to migrate to the ONL in eyes with AMD.

These data indicate Müller cell activation and remodeling in AMD.

"background, combined with her current research in preventing IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils, make her uniquely qualified to study novel therapies to prevent anaphylaxis. During the period of this proposal, Dr. Dispenza will continue to devote at least 75% effort towards patient-oriented translational research. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening IgE-mediated systemic allergic reaction with no known preventative therapies. There is a huge unmet need for therapies that can reduce the frequency and/or severity of anaphylactic reactions from both accidental and intentional exposures, the latter including desensitizations and immunotherapy. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key component of FcεRI signaling in human mast cells and basophils. Pharmacologic inhibitors of BTK are generally well tolerated, and preliminary data show that BTK inhibitors effectively block IgE-mediated human mast cell and basophil activation in vitro and in mouse models of anaphylaxis in vivo. Thus, it may be possible to utilize BTK inhibitors to proactively prevent allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that short-term use of FDA-approved BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib will prevent medication-induced anaphylaxis in both mouse models of anaphylaxis and in humans. If successful, BTK inhibitors could potentially be used to make drug desensitization safer and more cost effective, thus improving patient care and outcomes. Through this proposed research, Dr. Dispenza will work towards her long-term goal of becoming an independent translational physician-scientist. Short-term goals include (1) expanding research skills in mast cell biology, (2) learning to implement novel humanized mouse models of anaphylaxis, and (3) acquiring biostatistical and clinical trial skills for study design and implementation. After completion of this award, Dr. Dispenza will have had the needed training to design and implement further studies on the development of novel strategies to prevent anaphylaxis. To achieve these goals, an excellent mentoring team has been assembled. The primary mentor, Bruce Bochner, MD (Professor, Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine), has a strong track record of translational research in allergy including mast cell biology and has successfully trained many academicians. Donald MacGlashan, Jr, MD, PhD (Director, Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Johns Hopkins University), will serve as co-mentor, with additional expertise in mast cell and basophil activation and signaling. The mentoring team will oversee Dr. Dispenza’s progress in developing the necessary skills in order to support her transition into an independent investigator.",section,background,264.0,3024.0,387,5K23AI143965-04,Using BTK Inhibitors to Prevent Anaphylactic Drug Reactions,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5K23AI143965-04_chunk376,,,

"Project summary Mesolimbic dopamine, along with its ventral striatal targets, plays a major role in Pavlovian reward learning.

Pavlovian reward learning processes underlie many aspects of drug seeking behavior and play a critical role in drug relapse.

Instrumental learning processes also form a fundamental element of drug seeking behavior, and may depend on nigrostriatal dopamine innervation of dorsal striatum.

Here we seek to understand how mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine action within striatal targets mediates select components of reward-seeking behavior, and to test whether interactions between these systems contribute to normal and pathological reward-seeking behavior.

We focus on dopamine because both natural and drug rewards activate dopamine neurons, and, as confirmed in our recent findings, dopamine neuron activation, when substituted for reward, drives specific forms of associative learning implicated in addictive behavior.

Here, using the Th:Cre transgenic rat to limit channelrhodopsin expression to dopamine neurons, we take advantage of the ability to selectively activate mesolimbic dopamine neurons to better understand their impact on behavior, neural activity, and integration of ventral and dorsal striatal systems.

We test whether mesolimbic dopamine neuron reward-related activation recruits more dorsal striatal circuits during specific forms of learning.

A prominent hypothesis posits that reward seeking depends over time on more dorsal striatal circuits as behavioral control becomes habitual.

Thus, we also ask whether activating mesolimbic dopamine systems can hasten development of habitual responding for natural or drug reward.",results,semantic_chunk,,,231,5R01DA035943-10,Mechanisms of Dopamine Action in Learning: Implications for Addiction,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R01DA035943-10_chunk378,False,False,False

"approaches is urgent. There is emerging consensus that the lack of efficacy in AD clinical trials is attributable to disease heterogeneity. Accordingly, identifying predictors of specific AD endophenotypes that could become targets for intervention is of great interest. Among potential options, compelling evidence implicates the stress response as a promising candidate. Indeed, findings from numerous studies converge on the notion that individuals with a heightened sensitivity to stress are at greater risk of developing AD, suggesting that these individuals may represent a group who could be targeted in AD treatment trials. Translating these findings into clinical application has been hampered, however, by a lack of integration between studies that use rigorous experimental interrogation of the endocrine stress response and studies that include sophisticated characterization of patient samples. We aim to address this crucial gap. In this application, we propose to conduct a prospective study to examine the associations among the endocrine stress response, the negative cognitive effects of acute stress, and subsequent cognitive decline in 60 men and 60 women with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI). For our basic study design, we will induce acute stress with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and then measure the endocrine hormone and cognitive responses. The domains of memory and executive functioning will be the primary cognitive outcomes. Salivary samples collected at fixed intervals throughout the TSST will be used to measure stress hormone response; cortisol will be the primary hormone outcome.

"result in a wide range of neurological complications that affect various functional domains, with heterogeneous severity. Stratification of HIE subtypes and specific prognoses is essential for developing and delivering targeted adjuvant and rehabilitative treatments and is also necessary for medical providers in order to guide the appropriate allocation of resources. Although predictive biomarkers have been highly anticipated, as of yet, there are none validated. MRI has demonstrated strong predictive power for severe neurobehavioral deficits within the context of severe MRI findings. However, predicting outcomes following moderate-to-mild changes or even a normal-looking brain MRI does not guarantee normal neurobehavioral outcomes. With the recent advances in image analysis technologies, we intend to increase the sensitivity and negative predictive value by detecting and quantifying moderate-to-mild pathological changes, which are difficult to evaluate qualitatively. Since individualized prediction cannot be made from a single feature, as each feature weakly correlates with outcomes, we hypothesize that patient stratification, combining brain MRI features and clinical characteristics, will be highly accurate for individualized prediction. We will apply our automated structure-by-structure image quantification (SIQ) pipeline, developed and validated through R01HD065955, to be applied for the MRI quantification in this proposal.

For Aim 1, we will create a reference library that includes MRI atlases with various pathological changes due to HIE. Combined with the multi-atlas label fusion and lesion localization algorithms, the library enables a robust SIQ. For Aim 2, we will apply a supervised learning algorithm to the MRI features quantified by the SIQ to identify brain lesions and the severity that is associated with certain outcomes.

"Optic nerve demyelinating diseases such as Optic Neuritis (ON) cause acute reduction of visual acuity and often chronic visual loss.

The estimated incidence of ON in the USA is 6.4/100,000, and 50% of the 2.5 million multiple sclerosis (MS) patients worldwide are estimated to develop one or more episodes of ON during the course of their disease.

Myelination of the optic nerve is carried out by a specialized cell, the oligodendrocyte (OL), that coats and protects axons and promotes neural conduction.

Demyelination can cause apoptosis of the OLs, axonal damage, and neuronal cell death.

Remyelination-based treatments have the potential to help protect retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons and reduce chronic vision loss, and perhaps help restore lost vision.

The long-term goal of this project is to identify molecular pathways involved in differentiation and maturation of OLs that can be exploited for promoting remyelination of the demyelinated optic nerve.

To this end, the PI has developed human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporters for RGCs and OLs, and performed single cell RNA- sequencing and a preliminary high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify regulators of OL differentiation and maturation.

Based upon this preliminary data, the PI proposes to: 1) expand the screening effort to identify additional compounds and pathways involved in OL maturation, 2) examine the transcription factors and pathways identified from the preliminary work for their role in OL differentiation, and 3) further identify and systemically characterize microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in OL specification and maturation.",results,semantic_chunk,,,242,5R00EY029011-04,Developing Remyelination Strategies for Demyelinating Optic Neuropathies Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R00EY029011-04_chunk389,False,False,False

In the mentored phase, in Dr.

Don Zack’s lab, the PI will carry out genome-editing to generate the CRISPRi and CRISPRa lines and acquire training at Wilmer’s HCS facility where small molecule screening to probe for signaling pathways involved in OL maturation will be performed.

In the second year, under the guidance of Dr.

Jay Baraban (an expert in microRNA biology), the miRNA studies on OLs will be initiated.

The mentored phase will also be supplemented by training with Ingo Ruczinski (biostatistics collaborator), who will provide assistance with the pathway analysis and hit validation of HTS.

Furthermore, the PI’s co-mentor, Dr.

Peter Calabresi, who is a leading scientist in demyelinating diseases, will regularly meet, advise and help him prioritize the genes and pathways for further examination.

Additionally, during the mentored phase, the PI will regularly meet with his advisory committee, attend scientific conferences, and continue his career development.

The PI is in an ideal environment for the proposed research and for his career development as Dr.

Zack has an established hPSC lab, state-of-the-art HCS facilities, and collaborations with renowned neuroscientists and vision-scientists.

"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are closely-related, fatal neurodegenerative diseases with considerable genetic and pathologic overlap.

Postmortem analysis of more than 97% of ALS cases and nearly half of FTD cases demonstrates nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43, a primarily nuclear DNA- and RNA-binding protein that regulates pre-mRNA splicing.

Moreover, abundant evidence shows that the loss of TDP-43 nuclear function drives the evolution of many aspects of ALS/FTD pathogenesis.

This proposal seeks to build on recent data from our laboratory showing that RNA critically tethers TDP-43 within the nucleus and limits its passive nuclear export.

We propose to design a novel RNA-based strategy to oppose TDP-43 nuclear export, guided by two observations: 1) TDP-43 nuclear residence depends on its binding to GU-rich nuclear RNAs, and 2) small GU-rich RNA oligomers transfected into live cells efficiently target and modulate the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of TDP-43.

Here, we will develop bivalent RNA oligomers, termed TDP-43 nuclear targeting aptamers (TNTAs), to bind and retain the pool of free TDP-43 that would otherwise diffuse out of the nucleus.

The TNTA will consist of a reversible GU-rich TDP-43 targeting sequence (TTS), a linker, and a nucleus-targeting sequence (NTS), to anchor the TNTA-TDP-43 complex within stable nuclear ribonucleoprotein assemblies.

Using the (GU)6 sequence as a starting point, studies in aim 1 will further optimize the TTS motif, using the TDP-43 nuclear displacement assay as a readout for successful TTS-TDP-43 interaction.",methods,semantic_chunk,,,237,5R03NS127011-02,Development of TDP-43 nuclear targeting aptamers for ALS/FTD,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R03NS127011-02_chunk393,False,False,True
"Cells will be transfected by synthetic GU-rich RNAs (or poly-A, as a negative control), and the nuclear exit of endogenous TDP-43 will be monitored by immunofluorescence with automated confocal high-content microscopy.

The direct TTS-TDP-43 interaction, its selectivity towards TDP- 43, and reversibility over time will then be evaluated to identify the optimal TTS sequence.

In the second aim, the nuclear retention sequences of several classes of endogenous nuclear RNAs will be tested to identify optimal NTS sequences, that, when combined with the TTS can promote TDP-43 nuclear localization.

Nuclear tethering of TNTAs via the bacteriophage MS2-loop RNA-MCP system will be utilized as a positive control.

TNTAs combining the endogenous validated NTS linked to the GU-rich TTS will then be tested for activity in preventing TDP-43 exit.

Finally, the selectivity and reversibility of the TNTAs towards TDP-43 will be determined, and cryptic exon incorporation will be evaluated to ensure no interference with TDP-43 nuclear function.

Together, these studies will identify and optimize a new tool to promote TDP-43 nuclear localization, to enable further therapy development and improve our understanding of the regulation of TDP-43 nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling.",aims,semantic_chunk,,,185,5R03NS127011-02,Development of TDP-43 nuclear targeting aptamers for ALS/FTD,2023,,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,5R03NS127011-02_chunk394,False,False,False
