5T35DK131960-03,Short-Term Research Training Program in NIDDK Mission Areas,"Substantive research training early during the course of medical school education is critical to address the declining number of physicians choosing research careers. The proposed University of Illinois Short-Term Research Training Program (SRTP) will provide first year medical students (12 slots in Year 1, 15 in Year 2-5) with a 10-week mentored research experience in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) mission areas including, kidney, urologic and hematologic diseases; digestive disease and nutrition; and diabetes, endocrinology and metabolic disease. The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UI COM) is a large public medical school with one of the most diverse student populations in the country in terms of enrolled African American and Latino students. The program will draw from first year medical students at UI COM, as well as other medical schools in the Chicago metropolitan area and Midwest. We have assembled an outstanding team of mentors in NIDDK mission areas with expertise in basic/mechanistic, clinical/translational, and behavioral/community-based research. In addition to mentored research, students will participate in an interactive structured curriculum focused on research methodology, responsible conduct of research, and career development. To learn presentation skills and principles of rigor and reproducibility, students will co- lead, with a research mentor, journal clubs and works-in-progress sessions. Additional novel aspects of the program include use of peer-to-peer mentoring and ongoing exposure to successful early career physician- scientists. At the end of the summer, students will present at a SRTP Research Symposium and the COM Research Day. After the program is completed, the program will utilize multiple strategies to facilitate continued involvement in research activities, including encouraging students to apply to the James Scholar Program, a program that provides the infrastructure to support research during the second to fourth years of medical school. In addition, the program will strive to create a sense of community among SRTP cohorts by hosting quarterly “Ideas on Tap” (research/social networking events at which students present ongoing research), and will maintain connections with trainees using the program website, newsletters, an SRTP Slack communication channel, and social media. An Executive Committee will oversee implementation of the program, recruitment/selection, program evaluation, and tracking of short- and long-term outcomes. Strengths of the program include the experienced co-Directors, committed and well-funded program mentors with broad expertise across NIDDK mission areas, an innovative structured curriculum, a robust recruitment plan to enhance diversity, strong institutional support, and a thoughtfully conceived plan to foster continued research involvement after program completion. Consequently, the proposed SRTP will provide medical students with a substantive research experience, facilitating the achievement of the long-term objective of increasing the pipeline and diversity of physicians entering the research workforce in NIDDK mission areas.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3202,447,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R33HL155160-04,"The ALOHA trial: Addressing Quality of Life, Clinical Outcomes, and Mechanisms in Uncontrolled Asthma Following the DASH Dietary Pattern","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Asthma prevalence has increased markedly in the United States, with 19 million adults reporting current asthma and 62% of them with uncontrolled asthma. Poor diet quality is an important risk factor implicated in this alarming trend as a typical western diet features processed, energy-dense, nutrient-deficient foods, promoting a proinflammatory host environment. Diet quality in asthma is an emerging area of research; few interventional trials have investigated healthy dietary patterns in adults with asthma, none was adequately powered to determine efficacy, and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To fill this gap, the current 2-phase, milestone-driven ALOHA trial will rigorously evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of a behavioral intervention promoting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). This behavioral intervention showed promising results in a pilot trial among adults with uncontrolled asthma. METHODS: The R61 phase (1 year) will focus on finalizing trial planning and preparation and begin early enrollment; in the R33 phase (4 years) we will conduct a 2-arm randomized clinical trial over 12 months. Adults with uncontrolled asthma (n=320) on standard controller therapy will be equally randomized and assessed at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months. The control and intervention groups will be matched on the number, frequency, and format of sessions over 12 months while the length of each session is proportional to the content delivered. Control participants will receive education on lung health, asthma, and other general health topics using American Lung Association and UpToDate materials. The intervention group will receive the same health education and materials in addition to DASH behavioral counseling. Central hypothesis: Compared with the education-only control, the DASH behavioral intervention will lead to significantly more participants with a clinically significant improvement (responders) in asthma-specific quality of life (primary outcome) and significantly greater improvements in related asthma and non-asthma outcomes, which will be mechanistically linked to improved diet quality. SPECIFIC AIMS: First, to determine intervention efficacy on the primary outcome of clinically significant improvement in asthma-specific quality of life at 12 months and secondary outcomes (asthma control, lung function, generic qualify of life, blood pressure, mental health, sleep health). Second, to examine the intervention effects on metabolomic (circulating short-chain fatty acids: propionate, butyrate, acetate), immune response (interferon-gamma, IL-5, IL-17A, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα), and physiologic (bronchodilator responsiveness) biomarkers of asthma. Third, to examine the intervention effects on self- reported and objective indices of diet quality (DASH score, dietary inflammatory index, serum carotenoids). We also will conduct exploratory analyses of causal mediation linking diet quality, biomarkers, and asthma outcomes as well as effect modification by sex and other biological variables (age of asthma onset, atopy). IMPACT: This trial has high potential to advance the clinical and mechanistic understandings of diet quality in asthma.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3302,462,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DE033167-02,Dual Delivery of Engineered EVs and Growth Factor for Bone Regeneration,"The inflammatory conditions and the complex physiological changes associated with chronic immunological responses to wound healing in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) challenge the outcomes of the treatments for bone regeneration. The related morbidity and costs associated with bone healing failures are considerable and increasing. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that the immune system is tightly linked to bone physiology and that MSC derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a prominent role in immunomodulation of bone repair. While recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2) mediated bone regeneration is well established, the challenges of controlling inflammation arising from rhBMP2 usage is exacerbated in the presence of immunomodulating systemic diseases such as T2DM present a significant knowledge gap that limit clinical outcomes. Based on preliminary studies of inflammation informed MSC EV microRNA (miRNA) composition and effects on immunomodulation and bone regeneration, we hypothesize that a dual delivery of engineered MSC EVs with anti-inflammatory properties and rhBMP2 using a combinatorial delivery system with self-assembling leucine zipper (LZ) peptide-based hydrogels and alginate beads can enhance bone healing in T2DM. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. In aim 1, we will test our preliminary data driven hypothesis that a subset of altered miRNAs in preconditioned MSC EVs contributes to the enhanced immunomodulatory function of the inflammatory preconditioned MSC derived EVs. We will also generate engineered MSC EVs that overexpress candidate miRNA with anti-inflammatory properties to further study the mechanistic aspects by which individual EV related miRNAs control the immunomodulation functionality. In aim 2, we will create a novel dual delivery system with LZ-hydrogels and alginate beads that contain engineered EVs and rhBMP2 respectively. We will test our hypothesis that 1) EVs with anti-inflammatory properties (generated from aim 1) can be released during the inflammatory phase of healing (up to 7 days) from a self-assembling LZ- hydrogel and 2) rhBMP2 that is encapsulated in alginate beads with an extended-release profile (4-6 weeks) can provide a long term osteoinductive signal to promote/enhance bone regeneration. In aim 3, using a diabetic mouse calvarial defect model, we will test the hypothesis that engineered MSC EVs containing anti-inflammatory miRNA will suppress inflammation upon wounding while sustained released rhBMP2 promote bone healing. Overall, the results of these first studies of the combinatorial usage of engineered and MSC EVs rhBMP2 will provide a foundation for continued definition of MSC EV-mediated immunomodulation, and the regenerative properties and applicability of the dual delivery system to bone healing in T2DM. Further, these studies will also provide a framework for the use of growth factors and engineered EVs in combination for tissue engineering applications.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2991,429,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R01EY035221-01A1,Pathophysiology of Chronic and Delayed Mustard Gas Keratopathy,"This is an application to the Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) NIH-wide program part of the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program. Sulfur mustard (SM), a chemical warfare agent, and nitrogen mustard (NM), a chemotherapeutic agent, are both potent vesicants. The cornea is exquisitely sensitive to these agents leading to keratitis, vascularization, ulceration, and perforations. Following acute SM exposure, a subset of patients will experience chronic/delayed-onset ocular complications known as mustard gas keratopathy (MGK). Delayed MGK reportedly can manifest several years after the initial exposure and presents with severe corneal disease with significant visual loss. We have made the observation that in experimental animal models of NM injury to the cornea, there is dose-dependent increased senescence in the cornea. We hypothesize that senescence in the cornea promotes tissue dysfunction and inflammationand that senescence after mustard injury contributes to the progression of chronic MGK and the severity of delayed MGK. We further hypothesize that reducing/eliminating senescent cells may alter the progression and severity of MGK. In this application we propose in Aim1 to investigate the role of senescence and SASP in the progression of corneal disease following acute exposure to NM; and in Aim 2 to investigate the role of senescence in a new model of delayed MGK. At the conclusion of these studies, we expect to have an improved understanding of the role of senescence in the development of MGK and identify novel approaches for its prevention/treatment.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,1603,235,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1F30MH138058-01,Sleep as a Mechanism of Premenstrual Exacerbation of Depression and Suicidality,"Aligned with the NIMH 2023 Strategic Plan, which highlights suicide prevention and digital health as research priorities, the proposed project is consistent with NIH’s strategic goal to examine mental illness trajectories across the lifespan. The proposed project utilizes high-resolution digital health sleep data in a clinical trial to identify periods of acute suicide risk and potential sleep-related treatment targets, while also examining the impact of the menstrual cycle in these processes. Suicide is a leading cause of death, and it is important for ongoing studies to focus on when patients may be at imminent risk. Emerging research suggests the menstrual cycle and sleep disturbances are time-varying modulators of acute depression and suicidality. The primary mentor’s prior work substantiates a link between cyclical changes in ovarian steroids and suicidality and confirms that most patients recruited for recent suicidal ideation (SI) demonstrate perimenstrual worsening of SI. Further, the laboratory’s two crossover RCTs demonstrate that natural perimenstrual steroid withdrawal serves as a recurring trigger for worsened suicidality and depression that can be reversed with E2+P4 supplementation. However, treatment of this kind is not feasible long-term due to clotting and hormone-dependent cancer risks, so it is critical to identify physiological mediators of these effects which may be treatment targets. Sleep disturbances also predict acute increases in suicidality/depression and there is within-person worsening in sleep perimenstrually suggesting that sleep may be a time-varying physiological mediator for the relationship between the cyclical hormones and suicidality in some people. The proposed study will utilize archival data from the primary mentor’s recently completed R01-funded RCT, which the candidate was instrumental in collecting, in 150 AFAB transdiagnostic patients with suicidality, including 1-3 months of daily surveys, hormonally confirmed cycle phases, and wearable sleep data (Oura ring), to evaluate the role of sleep in perimenstrual exacerbation of SI/depression. The proposed study has several novel aspects: 1) High temporal resolution sleep data across long observation periods; 2) Analytic methods that consider individual differences in cyclical hormone sensitivity and sleep patterns; 3) Experimental ovarian hormone manipulation to establish causality in the relationship between sleep disturbances, cycling hormones, and suicidality/depression. The proposed project will provide clinical trial research experience, training in nomothetic and idiographic statistical modeling, and collaborative mentorship in methods and clinical exposure in sleep and reproductive psychiatry to help the candidate achieve long-term career goals in academic medicine.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2812,387,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R35GM146936-03,Pyroptosis is a Trial-by-Fire Program,"TITLE Pyroptosis is a Programmed Trial-by-Fire. PROJECT ABSTRACT The inflammatory cell death program pyroptosis occurs in a wide range of cell types and plays important roles in development, tissue injury, and tumor growth. Curiously, unlike other cell death mechanisms, cells frequently survive pyroptosis activation. The persistence of a family of “inefficient” cell death genes is puzzling and suggests they may have other roles. Intuitively, cells that survive the inflammatory insult will dictate both the short-term adaptation and long-term repair and regeneration afterwards. Therefore, a flawed death program may actually be a “trial”. However, the details of cell survival after pyroptosis and the biochemical circuitry beyond its activation are under-studied, hindering our basic understanding. In this Program, we hypothesize that cell death is a side- effect of pyroptosis, which in fact aims to reprogram cell functions. To explore the new concept that “trial-by-fire” provides strong evolutionary advantages, we will investigate 1) whether it is possible to stop/resume pyroptosis and the basic mechanisms used to exert such control; 2) the capacity and limits of pyroptosis signaling; and 3) the single cell phenotypic effects of weathering pyroptosis. In pursuing this central hypothesis, we will discover new cell signaling circuits and simultaneously enhance the field’s ability to detect novel pathways by developing new genetically encoded tools, imaging algorithms, and bioinformatics methods. The Program aims to construct a new perspective that the salient function of pyroptosis is to prime and educate through a near-death experience.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,1659,240,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1F30HD116496-01,Investigation of Social and Behavioral Drivers of HIV Risk Among South African Adolescent Girls and Young Women,"South Africa has the greatest burden of HIV infection in the world, and South African adolescent girls and young women (SA-AGYW) ages 15-24 are at greatest risk. Mental health distress (anxiety, trauma, depression) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are implicated as drivers of HIV, yet few studies have assessed the combined effects of mental health and IPV on SA-AGYW sexual risk behavior (early sexual debut, no condom use at last sex, multiple sexual partners). Notably, high warmth and frequent communication about sexual topics between female caregivers and AGYW are associated with reduced AGYW sexual risk behavior, but few studies have examined the impact of female caregiver-AGYW communication and warmth in the presence of mental health distress and IPV on AGYW sexual risk taking. The proposed fellowship will provide much needed training to prepare me for a career as a physician scientist with a global health program of research. Guided by an expert mentorship team to oversee my training activities, I will gain skills in adolescent and young adult mental health distress, sexual risk behaviors, and their roles as drivers of HIV infection, HIV epidemiology, advanced qualitative research, and complete my medical and PhD degrees. I will use these new skills to carry out a mixed methods research study integrating quantitative and qualitative methods to accomplish two specific aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct secondary analyses of baseline data from a large HIV prevention intervention involving SA-AGYW and their female caregivers (IMARA-SA). Analyses of 642 AGYW will examine mental health distress, IPV, and AGYW-caregiver warmth and communication as drivers of AGYW sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Preliminary data from the parent study revealed high rates mental health distress and IPV. I hypothesize that increased warmth and communication between AGYW and female caregivers will decrease the association between mental health distress and sexual risk behaviors even in the presence of IPV. In Aim 2, I will supplement the quantitative analysis with 20- 30 qualitative interviews with SA-AGYW with experiences of IPV. I will purposively select participants from the parent study who have completed the 12-month follow up and reported IPV. Interviews will offer new insight into the impact of female caregiver communication about addressing experiences of IPV and sexual risk behavior. The findings from aims 1 and 2 will inform interventions to improve the SA-AGYW mental health, lessen IPV exposure, and strengthen sexual and reproductive health. Mentorship provided by an experienced team with a long history of collaboration will ensure excellent training, extensive opportunities to publish in high impact journals and present at international scientific conferences, and exposure to colleagues through networking. This F30 fellowship will provide a well-rounded education that empowers me to become a physician-scientist with a program of research focused on AGYW sexual and reproductive health.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3042,458,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL161386-03,Role of Adiposomes in Diabetes-Associated Endothelial Dysfunction and Restorative Effects of Exercise and Metabolic Surgery,"The development of type II diabetes (T2D) is strongly associated with obesity, and both are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Vascular dysfunction is an early event in developing cardiovascular disease in obese diabetic (OB-T2D) patients. Therefore, we set our long-term goal to define molecular mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and corrective strategies that target these mechanisms, such as physical activity and weight loss. We recently discovered that human adipose tissues release extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) that are efficiently captured by endothelial cells. Adiposomes are known to carry bioactive cargos such as proteins and micro RNAs; however, their lipid content has not been studied, neither their ability to transfer their lipid cargo to endothelial cells. In the current application, we propose investigating the role of adiposomes in communicating the unhealthy milieu, mainly dysregulated lipids, to endothelial cells in OB-T2D subjects. On top of these lipid species that we propose to be carried by adiposomes are glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs originate from ceramide glycosylation, a chemical process that is upregulated in the presence of inflammation and high glucose levels. Our preliminary findings showed that in endothelial cells, GSL-rich adiposomes disturb plasma membrane structure and subsequently induces endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, we found preconditioning endothelial cells with high shear stress (which is an exercise mimetic) protected endothelial cells from the detrimental effects caused by adiposomes. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that adipose tissues in OB-T2D patients release GSL-loaded adiposomes that induce vascular endothelial dysfunction. We propose that exercise and weight loss interventions (bariatric surgery) will restore adipose tissue homeostasis, reduce GSL-loaded adiposomes, and subsequently alleviate vascular risk in OB-T2D patients. We will test our hypotheses by pursuing the following Aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of GSL-rich adiposomes in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in OB- T2D adults; Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of exercise training in reducing adiposome-mediated effects on vascular function; and Aim 3: Examine changes in adiposome/caveolae axis following metabolic surgery and their association with vascular function. This study will improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological underpinning of adiposome production, packaging, and role in inducing ED under conditions of obesity and T2D. It will also identify adiposomes and the proposed mechanisms of their interaction with endothelial cells as novel therapeutic targets for improving vascular function in OB-T2D individuals. Once these pathways are elucidated, strategies for targeting them can be advanced, leading to an improved therapeutic management of T2D-related cardiovascular disease.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2898,398,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL152515-04,Amplification Mechanisms of Lung Endothelial Inflammation During Acute Lung Injury,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Lung failure from endotoxemia and sepsis induces widespread and often rapid lung vascular endothelial injury due to unfettered influx of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. This maladaptive inflammatory response outpaces the reparative capacity of lungs, resulting in profound inflammatory lung injury and hypoxemia. This proposal focuses on fundamental amplification mechanisms underlying the maladaptive inflammatory activation of the lung endothelium. Our central hypothesis is that the inflammatory response to threat signals such as the initial breaching of the endothelial plasma membrane by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rapid release of mitochondrial DNA by the injured mitochondria into the cytosol massively and acutely amplifies the inflammatory response and thus serves as essential feed-forward mechanisms for progression of acute lung injury (ALI). In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which the recently identified perforin Gasdermin D mediates endothelial plasma membrane pore formation and the mechanisms of activation of the K+ efflux ion channel TWIK2 that we have recently identified. We will address the role of amplifying K+ efflux on the severity and rapidity of endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and fulminant lung injury. In Aim 2, we will define another crucial amplification mechanism, the potentially important role of Gasdermin D-mediated mitochondrial (mt) membrane pore formation and the release of mtDNA, which may also catastrophically amplifiy lung injury via activation of Type I interferon signaling. These mechanistically driven studies will utilize genetic mouse models (endothelial specific knockout models in our labs) as well as comprehensive imaging, electrophysiological and physiological approaches and thus provide the framework for identifying novel endothelial amplification inflammatory mechanisms that induce lung vascular injury and ALI. We will elucidate how these pathways can be targeted to reduce tissue damage and improve survival.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2059,287,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01MD014839-04,Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE),"This application proposes to examine a novel social epigenetic mechanism for racial inequality in lung cancer: Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE). We will examine the relationships between exposure to violence, inflammatory responses, smoking and epigenetic changes in protein arginine methyl transferases (PRMT6) that increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that smoking induces increased expression of PRMT6 in the lung epithelium. We also showed that overexpression of PRMT6 triggers spontaneous lung tumors in mice. Interestingly, we found that PRMT6 is upregulated among black men compared with white men in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thus we argue that the increased overexpression of PRMT6 among black men may explain a higher rate of lung cancer among black men compared with white men. While smoking is a key contributing factor for lung cancer, the frequency and amount of cigarette smoking are not necessarily higher for blacks, which suggests that other factors are responsible for racial disparity in lung cancer. Disproportionate social stress in black communities may be responsible for a higher rate of lung cancer among blacks. In particular, individuals living in excessive neighborhood violence are exposed to chronic stress, which may intensify the epigenetic changes for lung cancer. We hypothesize that exposure to neighborhood violence is social stress that increases biophysical inflammatory responses, which exacerbate the path between smoking, PRMT6 overexpression, and lung cancer. To examine the proposed social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity, first, we will test the independent effect of smoking and exposure to neighborhood violence, and the interaction of the two risks on PRMT6 expression using retrospective tissue samples from black and white lung cancer cases (Aim 2). Second, we will test the effect of exposure to violence on an inflammatory response (hair cortisol) and lung cancer screening outcomes by conducting a prospective survey and data collection with high-risk black men (Aim 3). Finally, we will build a multilevel, context-specific lung cancer risk profiles (Aim 1) that take into account not only individual behavioral risk (smoking), but neighborhood stress (exposure to violence), physiological inflammatory responses (increased cortisol), and molecular changes (PRMT6 overexpression). To develop such risk profiles, we utilize a composite population data approach to establish accurate counts of all individuals within census tracts with sociodemographic, behavioral, and neighborhood risk profiles. The strength of RECODE is its innovative approach to unveil a social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity. RECODE has the potential to transform understanding multilevel risks of lung cancer and improve the national lung cancer screening guidelines to reflect the social conditions of racial minority communities.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3013,433,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R24EY033598-03,Alleviation of ER stress as a translational strategy to curb ocular viral infections,"Infection-associated blindness caused by herpesviruses is a leading cause of vision loss in the United States. Frontline therapies include the use of nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir which inhibit the viral thymidine kinase to restrict viral DNA replication. However, emergence of drug resistance and lack of strong corneal bioavailability have made it an urgent priority to develop alternative therapeutics. We have recently discovered a new mechanism through which herpesviruses, exemplified by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), propagate in the corneal epithelium. We have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized host protein cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) is essential to HSV-1 replication. Our findings shift the current understanding that CREB3 is only a cellular homolog of HSV-1 VP16. We showed that it is an important pro-viral factor that can be exploited to generate novel therapeutics against HSV infections. We for the first time showed that its modulation via a chemical chaperone 4- phenylbutyrate sodium (Na-PBA), can alleviate, ER stress, reduce CREB3 expression and inhibit viral replication. PBA is currently approved to treat urea cycle disorder. Our translational results are supported by strong in vivo murine data that suggests antiviral efficacy and topical dosage safety of Na-PBA. Due to the high sodium burden associated with Na-PBA administration, its unpalatability, and inability to penetrate sufficiently through corneal epithelium upon topical administration, we have developed various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations to overcome limitations associated with oral and topical delivery of Na-PBA. The purpose of this R24 application is to generate preclinical data in two animal models that support an IND application for repurposing PBA to treat ocular HSV infection. This will be achieved via 3 well thought, exhaustive specific aims. In the first aim, we will evaluate dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, and safety of orally and topically delivered Na-PBA solution and various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations. Furthermore, we will also determine oral and topical, and oral antiviral efficacy of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA nanoformulations in murine models of ocular HSV-1 infection. The second aim will use the most effective oral and topical formulation(s) and test their safety, PK, and efficacy in guinea pig and rabbit models of primary and reactivated ocular HSV-1 infection. Finally aim 3, we will investigate the potential of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA formulations to synergize with existing antiviral therapies to determine their potential as an add-on modality to the existing treatment. The latter is likely and significant since PBA is a rare drug that works via alleviating ER stress and aiding the host cell’s response to viral infection, and thereby reducing the chance for emergence of viral resistance. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team including scientists, clinicians, drug development and translation experts who can help us navigate through requisite FDA guidelines. PBA has the potential to become a safe and efficacious alternative to existing ocular antivirals very quickly.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3211,467,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5P50AA022538-10,Epigenetic Mechanisms of Positive  Affective State of AUD,"Project Summary As a hallmark of alcohol use disorder (AUD), the withdrawal syndrome includes both negative symptoms like anxiety and motivational symptoms such as craving for alcohol, which promotes relapse and alcohol seeking. Understanding how alcohol withdrawal changes brain physiology is an important step towards developing effective treatments to reduce alcohol abuse. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is an important brain area that projects to components of the extended amygdala, including the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Changes in the physiology of VTA neurons induced by withdrawal may underlie the alcohol-seeking during AUD. The sensitivity of neurons of the VTA to inhibition by gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is decreased during alcohol withdrawal but normalized by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, indicating epigenetic changes induced by withdrawal in the VTA may be amenable to pharmacological manipulation. Whole genome sequencing and molecular studies of this project identified a cluster of genes that encode cholesterol synthesis pathway enzymes that showed decreased expression during alcohol withdrawal, and are functionally relevant to decreased GABA sensitivity in VTA neurons during withdrawal. The proposed project plans to further characterize the role of specific epigenetic modifications in withdrawal-induced regulation of genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis, and the effect of these changes in withdrawal-induced GABA hyposensitivity and drinking behaviors. By using electrophysiological, behavioral, and state of the art molecular biological methods such as chemogenetics and CRISPR technology, we anticipate achieving the following goals: 1) to reveal novel epigenetic marks and changes in gene expression associated with chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal with whole genome approaches, 2) to examine whether decreased histone acetylation and increased histone methylation reduce expression of cholesterol synthesis enzymes in the VTA during withdrawal in a cell-type specific manner, and probe the role of cholesterol synthesis enzyme genes in withdrawal-related drinking behavior and GABA hyposensitivity, 3) to determine whether targeted epigenetic intervention counteracts withdrawal-induced phenotypes by using CRISPR to prevent decreases in histone acetylation on promoters of key cholesterol synthesis enzyme genes, and 4) to translate to post-mortem human alcoholic VTA the epigenetic dynamics and expression of genes related to GABA hyposensitivity that have been identified in the rat VTA. Ultimately, these studies are needed to understand epigenetic adaptation of VTA neurons involved in the positive affective state during alcohol withdrawal, and, with the other components of this Center, will provide a great deal of information on epigenetic mechanisms involved in withdrawal-induced brain changes, and possible pharmacological approaches toward more effective treatment of AUD.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2987,409,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

During the current funding period, the Epigenetics Core identified gene networks both induced and repressed by alcohol exposure or withdrawal in the amygdala, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area and limbic cortex and specific target genes that showed changes in RNA levels, as well as, in H3K9/14ac levels were functionally validated. In the current submission, the proposed Aims will allow preclinical CARE Research Projects (Projects 1-3) to obtain novel information regarding genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and histone methylation (H3K27me3 ChIP-seq). These findings will be integrated with data obtained during the current funding period (RNA-seq and H3K9/14ac ChIP-seq). We will also perform ATAC-seq and RNA-seq in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the alcohol use disorder (AUD)/control cohort obtained from the New South Wales Tissue Resource Center (Project 4). In addition, we will investigate the across genome levels of 5- hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in the same tissue using Illumina’s EPIC Methylation Array. Results from these studies will reveal brain region-selective changes in genes that are likely to contribute to alcohol use disorders. The above studies constitute Aim 1 of the Core. Aim 2 proposes bioinformatics pipelines for the analyses of the genome-wide datasets and the 5hmC array and integrating the large datasets for both preclinical and post- mortem studies. The integration of datasets from multiple non-biased approaches is innovative and will provide context for interpreting changes in the gene regulatory landscape in response to withdrawal from alcohol. In Aim 3, we propose to employ a novel dCas9:P300 acetyl transferase fusion protein to alter acetylation levels at specific genomic loci. This will allow us to activate expression of key genes in specific brain regions by altering acetylation selectively at their corresponding promoters. Similarly, we will use a dCas9:Tet1 fusion protein to alter 5mC and 5hmC levels at glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) to modulate mRNA expression. The Epigenetics Core is using state-of-the-art technology to obtain genome-wide information to provide additional resources for each CARE component to address their specific hypotheses. The Core will perform quality control measures at many of the key steps of the protocols described above. In addition, key findings in the genome-wide measures will be validated by Core personnel in consult with Project leaders.

1U54HD113087-01,Training Core,"Training Core Abstract Rising rates of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among those who face persistent disparities, not only demand new approaches to transdisciplinary research, but these inequities mandate the training of a new research, clinical, and public health workforce who can address these challenges. This workforce must have a knowledge base that is steeped in the structural, environmental, behavioral, and biological factors that affect women’s maternal health, including pregnancy-related/associated mortality and severe maternal morbidity. In addition, the maternal health workforce must include those who represent communities typically underrepresented in the research, clinical care delivery, and public health. Commitment to the rigorous training and exposure of this workforce to a wide variety of diverse and transdisciplinary concepts, methods, and approaches to etiologic and intervention research is paramount. As such, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Maternal Health Research Center of Excellence proposes the development of a Training Program to build the research capacity of early stage investigators (ESIs), junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, research assistants (RAs), as well as clinical partners from community agencies who together will have a diverse set of skills and experiences to enable them to bring fresh insights, ask novel questions, and discover innovative approaches to reducing inequities in maternal health outcomes. A. Specific Aims 1. To increase the diversity of the maternal health research pipeline by recruiting and supporting the academic career development of racially and ethnically diverse postdoctoral and junior faculty fellows from a variety of clinical and public health backgrounds. 2. To develop and successfully implement a robust training program for early stage investigators, including junior clinical and public health faculty and post-doctoral fellows, to enable them to address a variety of research questions related to reducing maternal health inequities using innovative quantitative and qualitative research methods and strategies. 3. To provide community-based clinical partners with a robust research training experience that will enable them to successfully undertake or partner with investigators to conduct maternal health research. 4. To provide a strong research and journey mentoring program to early stage investigators to enable them to effectively address maternal health issues including reducing inequities in maternal health outcomes.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2554,355,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5F30AI164843-04,Deciphering molecular mechanisms underlying vertical transmission of Listeria monocytogenes,"Pregnant women are more likely to be infected with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) than the general population, and the bacterium can be vertically transmitted leading to fetal infection and pregnancy loss. Despite its public/health/relevance, the determinants of maternofetal transmission remain undefined. Examination of clinical Lm isolates indicates that subpopulations of strains possess an enhanced ability for vertical transmission. One of these strains, 07PF0776, was first noted for its ability to target the heart, and this cardiotropism requires InlB, a bacterial surface protein known to be important for the invasion of mammalian cells. Experimental evidence indicates that InlB is similarly required for vertical transmission and that high InlB expression alone is sufficient to significantly enhance vertical transmission in an unrelated strain. The goal for this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which InlB enhances the vertical transmission of hypervirulent Lm strains and of Lm generally. The project aims are designed to connect strain-specific genetic variations to altered bacterial behavior, host pathology, and immune responses. The current working hypothesis is that enhanced translation of inlB occurs in Lm hypervirulent subpopulations as the result of a trinucleotide substitution in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the inlB transcript that promotes ribosome binding. It is also hypothesized that amino acid variations within InlB enhance InlB binding to the bacterial cell wall and thus increase InlB surface abundance. Aim 1 will determine how InlB levels are altered in 07PF0776 by looking at InlB synthesis, degradation, and cell wall affinity. This aim will also explore how the 5’ UTR contributes to increased protein expression. Aim 2 will determine how increased InlB expression promotes bacterial colonization of the placenta and fetus. Experiments will use pregnant mice as a model and compare strains with varying levels of InlB activity. Fluorescence microscopy combined with immuno-histochemistry will determine if InlB-high-expressing strains have enhanced invasion of specific placental cell types, or alternatively gain access through new portals of entry. RNAScope in situ hybridization and flow cytometry will establish how bacterial localization impacts the nature of the placental immune response. The ultimate goal of the above aims will be to establish the mechanisms by which strains of Lm cause severe fetal and neonatal disease. These studies may eventually allow for improved treatment of severe Lm infection and more effective strategies to protect pregnant women from Lm-induced pregnancy complications.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2694,389,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DE031737-03,Role of DMP1 Mediated Paracrine Signaling in Vasculogenesis,"For dentin repair or regeneration, it is important to have the timely appearance of blood vessels. Therefore, tissue-engineering strategies to regenerate the dentin-pulp complex require establishment of vasculature to deliver oxygen, nutrients, hormones, immune cells, minerals and also help in clearing cellular debris and metabolic waste products during the inflammatory and regenerative phases of healing. DMP1 (dentin matrix protein1) is a key regulatory protein in bone and dentin mineralization. We first demonstrated that it has a regulatory role in the regulation of hydroxyapatite nucleation and growth in the extracellular matrices of bone and dentin. Subsequently, we demonstrated that DMP1 was localized in the nucleus of preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts and thus served as a signaling molecule and promoted the differentiation of these precursor cells. Recently we discovered that DMP1 can stimulate the release of intracellular calcium in preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts. Depletion of intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum leads to ER stress. Cells cope with ER stress by activating the “Unfolded protein response” (UPR). One of our recent observations is that DMP1 stimulation can promote the secretion of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that ER stress activated by DMP1 functions to promote the transformation of adult stem cells such as dental pulp stem cells to endothelial cells and thereby promote vasculogenesis. In order to determine the mechanism by which DMP1 promotes vasculogenesis, we will examine the UPR signaling pathway. The UPR is initiated by three ER transmembrane proteins, of which our preliminary data show that DMP1 stimulation activated the ATF6 (Activating Transcription Factor 6) arm of the UPR. Accordingly, here we propose to study the mechanism by which ATF6 mediate transcriptional regulation of VEGF under ER stress. During dentin repair and regeneration, a major challenge is the maintenance of cell viability which depends on the availability of a functional vascular system. Accordingly, we will test the in-vivo vasculogenic competence and therapeutic potential of DMP1 in an in vivo pulp regeneration model. Understanding the complex functions of DMP1 could be valuable to develop therapies for fracture repair in bone or in the tooth to restore lost, damaged or diseased dentin-pulp complex.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2396,352,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R21AG080316-02,Co-translational Regulation in the Vasculature of Organ Systems with Aging,"The production of functional proteins is a multistep process whereby newly synthesized polypeptides are enzymatically processed, folded, and assembled into oligomeric complexes. Key maturation processes occur co-translationally by coupling mRNA translation and nascent protein maturation on the ribosomes, assisted by a network of regulatory proteins. Despite decades of basic research, our understanding of co-translational processes is shaped predominantly by genetic manipulations in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell models, but limited data exists in cells from intact mammalian physiological systems. To overcome this hurdle, this project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of co-translational regulation of nascent proteins as they reach their functional state within the angiogenic signaling pathways of the endothelium in the heart during aging. We have recently developed an approach and tested the potential for simultaneous isolation of proteins present within the actively translating polyribosome/mRNA complexes within the endothelium of the heart. State-of-the-art multiplex labelling and quantification of these proteins has permitted the identification of concordant and discordant regulated cell-specific pathways based on actively translating mRNA and protein profiles associated with the endothelial stress. Leveraging this innovative advancement in “functional co- translatomics”, we aim to study the changes in co-translational complexes within endothelial cell angiogenic ligand-receptor and cell-cell interaction signaling networks within the aging heart. In Aim 1 , we will define changes in the co-translational regulation of concordantly regulated angiogenic signaling pathways during neonatal and adult life with aging and gender. In Aim 2 , we will define the post-translational modifications of proteins within discordantly regulated angiogenic signaling pathways which may contribute to the impairment angiogenesis in the heart during aging. Ultimately this knowledge could aid in the development of more effective means for diagnosing and treating the impairment of angiogenesis that occurs with aging and predisposes the heart to cardiovascular disease and injury.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2206,296,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01AA031003-02,Role of RMTg afferents in mechanisms of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure,"PROJECT SUMMARY A significant number of individuals struggle to maintain sobriety as a result of withdrawal symptoms that emerge during early abstinence from alcohol. Despite this, pharmacotherapeutics for the treatment of withdrawal are lacking, at least in part, due to poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying symptoms of withdrawal. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is a GABAergic region that exerts inhibitory control over midbrain bioaminergic and cholinergic nuclei. Recently, work from our lab revealed significantly enhanced cFos expression, a marker of recent neuronal activity, in the RMTg of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposed rats 12 hours into acute withdrawal. In addition, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of the RMTg attenuates withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. However, the precise neural circuits that drive this putative RMTg hyperactivity is unknown. The lateral habenula (LHb) provides dense glutamatergic input to the RMTg and exhibits significant functional overlap with the RMTg. In addition, our preliminary data reveals a significant increase in cFos expression in RMTg-projecting lateral habenula (LHb) neurons during acute withdrawal. Together, these data lead us to hypothesize that LHb inputs to the RMTg play a mechanistic role in regulating symptoms of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. Experiments in the current proposal are designed to test this hypothesis by using in vivo chemogenetics to bidirectionally and selectively manipulate LHb-RMTg activity during behavioral tests of withdrawal symptoms including anxiety-like behavior, mechanical pain sensitivity, and impulsive choice. Additional work will use ex vivo slice electrophysiology to explore the physiological neuroadaptations that occur in this circuitry during withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. Findings from these experiments will shed new light onto the role of this neural circuit in regulating symptoms of withdrawal and by extension have the potential to uncover new neurobiological targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2092,292,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

5R01CA258683-02,Adaptation and implementation of a patient navigation program for cervical cancer screening across contexts in Senegal,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT Cervical cancer mortality is expected to increase by 42% to 442,926 deaths worldwide by 2030. Currently 85% of incident cervical cancers and 87% of cervical cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Due in large part to the low utilization of cervical cancer screening services, Senegal ranks 17th in the world for cervical cancer incidence. For women ages 40 to 49 in rural regions of the country the cervical cancer screening rate is very low at less than 2%. As a result women often present with mostly preventable late stage cancers. Secondary prevention programs (cervical cancer screening) are critical to effectively achieving global progress toward the elimination of human papillomavirus related cancers. However, considerable context variation across geographic- and health system-levels in LMICs markedly obstructs the community responsiveness of an implemented program. Lessons learned from higher resource countries show that incidence and mortality rates decline and early deaths are prevented with early detection and appropriate follow- up and treatment. Prior efforts and pilot studies in Senegal show that there is slow uptake, poor follow-up, and low treatment rates for women who are screened positive. Patient navigation is a strategy to eliminate barriers to screening, timely diagnosis, and follow-up to improve cancer outcomes in vulnerable populations. In high-income countries, patient navigation has demonstrated considerable effectiveness in its ability to address communication, information, medical system, and emotional barriers to timely care across all phases of the cancer care continuum, including detection, diagnosis, treatment, and post-treatment quality of life. Patient navigation programs enhance access to care, promote self-efficacy, and sustain patient engagement with care, and have been shown to improve cancer outcomes, particularly among marginalized groups, rural populations, and impoverished communities. The goal of this project is to prevent unnecessary deaths due to cervical cancer in Senegal. This mixed methods research responds to identified intrapersonal- and community-level barriers to early cervical cancer screening uptake, follow-up, and treatment among women there. We will apply the Dynamic Adaptation Process to study the adaptation of an evidence-based cervical cancer patient navigation program in urban and rural contexts of Senegal, measure the intervention effectiveness, and evaluate programmatic implementation outcomes. By studying the process of adaptation of a patient navigation program in a low- and middle-income country, we will apply implementation science to a novel context. With a particular focus on how the adaptation responds to cancer-related stigma and women’s autonomy in healthcare decision-making, our project demonstrates additional innovation. The process knowledge generated will further our long-term goal to inform the national cervical cancer prevention and control programs in Senegal and other low- and middle-income countries.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3075,433,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DK132398-02,Regulation of beige adipocyte maintenance and its impact on metabolic outcomes,"Title: Regulation of beige adipocyte maintenance and its impact on metabolic outcomes Project Summary/Abstract A potential therapeutic target to curb the global obesity and diabetes epidemic is thermogenic beige fat within white adipose tissue (WAT). Unlike white adipocyte which stores fat, beige adipocytes are stimulated thermogenic fat cells in WAT that robustly consume lipid and glucose. However, Beige adipocytes quickly disappear upon the removal of stimuli, a process further accelerated by age and obesity. This creates a key challenge to explore beige adipocytes as a sustainable therapy for chronic metabolic diseases. A long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand the development and maintenance of beige adipocytes, and the metabolic outcomes. In our preliminary studies using unique mouse models, we demonstrate that beige adipocytes can be induced and maintained by pharmacological and genetical measures. Further, our preliminary results suggest that these induced beige adipocytes are maintained in the older mice, even without continuous stimulation. These exciting findings, although preliminary in nature, suggest novel measures to use beige adipocyte as potential therapeutics to treat obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases. In this application, we will investigate whether the sustained beige adipocytes can improve the metabolic fitness under both health and disease conditions, thereby achieving anti-obesity and anti-diabetes effects. Furthermore, we will elucidate the critical molecular mechanisms by which beige adipocyte identity is preserved. In addition, we will employ cell- type selective transcriptomic approach to comprehensively characterize the molecular components involved in beige adipocyte maintenance.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,1759,243,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HD100023-04,Resolving Spatiotemporally-Specific Multicellular Dynamics In Vivo During Olfactory Neurogenesis,"Project Summary While many neurological defects and disorders are known to result from developmental perturbations in specific cell types and/or are linked to well-studied signaling pathways, the system-level coordination of multiple cell populations and the spatiotemporal specificity of their signaling outputs during neurogenesis remains poorly understood. The long-term objective of this proposal is to take advantage of the accessible and rapidly developing zebrafish olfactory epithelium to quantitatively characterize cell-cell signaling pathways and multicellular behaviors that drive the assembly of complex neuronal populations in vertebrates. Proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways provide spatially- and temporally- sensitive cues to guide stem cell migration into the olfactory epithelium and regulate sensory neurogenesis. Small subsets of cells will be manipulated and analyzed completely in vivo, at subcellular spatial resolution and with sub-minute temporal resolution, so as to determine the system-level coordination of stem cell migration, specification, and differentiation during both normal and disrupted signaling. First, new tools and techniques will be used to perturb Wnt signaling in vivo at specific times and locations during olfactory development and to algorithmically model and explain progenitor cells’ migratory behavior. Next, Notch signaling will be manipulated in vivo to quantitate its effects on olfactory system-wide neurogenesis, and target genes will be identified that are required for neuronal specification and/or differentiation. Finally, the transcription factor insm1a will be similarly investigated to determine its role in Notch signaling-mediated olfactory neurogenesis. The approaches in this proposal will directly analyze in vivo data to understand and predict multicellular behavior without reducing biological complexity and help uncover phenotypes that may advance our broad understanding of system-wide neuronal differentiation and assembly in vivo.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2058,276,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL045638-35,Programming of PMN host-defense function during transendothelial migration,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN or neutrophil) maintain human health by rapidly eliminating the invading pathogens. These circulating cells transmigrate across the endothelial adherens junctions (AJs) to enter into the infected tissue and to clear the pathogens. Little is known about the role of mechanical forces which PMN experience during transmigration across the endothelium. Our Supporting Data describe the potentially important role of adherens junctions in activating PMN’s host defense function. We observed that activation of PMN-expressed Piezo1 during paracellular transmutation induced calcium influx, which in turn, promptly stabilized Hif1α and upregulated expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) in PMN to program these cells to efficient “killers” of the pathogens. These findings have for the first time linked PMN-expressed Piezo1 to the host-defense function, leading to the fundamental question “how Ca2+ influx in PMN via Piezo1 program the host-defense function of PMN?” In Aim 1, we will determine the role of PMN-expressed Piezo1 signaling pathway in activating the host-defense function of transmigrating PMN. Here we will delineate the signaling pathways downstream of Piezo1 activation that promptly stabilizes Hif1α in PMN and programs PMN to become more efficient bacterial “killers”. The studies will involve genetic analysis of Piezo1- Hif1α signaling of the transmigrating PMN such as PMN-specific Piezo1 and Hif1α knockout mice. We will also determine whether pharmacological activation of Piezo1 or expression of gain-of-function Piezo1 mutant in PMN is sufficient to activate the PNM defense system in the relevant P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia model. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of PMN-expressed Nox4 in regulating oxidative and lytic properties of PMN and in the efficient elimination of pathogens in lung. These studies will address the function of Nox4 in PMN in the mechanism of innate immune defense program. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, we will determine how Hif1α induces activation of Nox4 gene and how Nox4 regulates oxidative and lytic properties of phagolysosome and efficient pathogen killing. The proposed studies will be essential for understanding the regulation of PMN host-defense function with the goal of identifying therapeutic potential of Piezo1 activators.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2366,346,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R21AI172116-01A1,Discovery of a pigment produced by Streptococcus pyogenes,"Discovery of a pigment produced by Streptococcus pyogenes Abstract This proposal seeks to advance a new observation that the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) produces a pigment that has gone unreported. We hypothesize the pigment protects GAS from host-derived and/or environmental stressors (such as reactive oxygen species) and likely enhances its fitness and potentially augments its virulence. For 80 years, no reference in the literature exists of a pigment being produced by this important organism, and prior to that, only two citations allude to such a factor. We suspect this property has been overlooked because its presence only becomes apparent in the laboratory after culturing in a chemically defined medium, grown to high cell densities, and after exposure to oxygen. Understanding if and how the production of a pigment could boost the fitness of GAS could provide a new target that therapeutics or vaccines could take aim upon. The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the composition and structure of the GAS pigment, to identify genes associated with its production and regulation, and to characterize its ability to protect GAS from stressors and immune cell killing while exploring any cytotoxic properties.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,1270,195,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5UG1EY030410-05,Study of Latinos (SOL) Ojos,"This application proposes an ancillary eye study to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). HCHS/SOL is a prospective, population-based, multicenter cohort, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and 6 other National Institutes of Health (NIH) Institutes, that is designed to 1) assess disease burden; and, 2) address cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep disorders, dental caries and periodontal disease, hearing impairment, diabetes, kidney and liver disease, and cognitive impairment. This landmark study, the largest ever conducted in Hispanics/Latinos, constitutes a national resource of extensive, high-quality phenotypic and genotypic data. Participants include those of Mexican, Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Central and South American, and Other origins. HSHC/SOL recruited 16,415 participants for Visit #1 (2008-2011); data collection for Visit #2 (2014-2017) concluded 12/17 (Chicago and Miami Field Centers: 82.3% participation rate); and, NHLBI contracted HCHS/SOL Visit #3 (2019-2022) funding to serve as a platform for ancillary studies. We will recruit and perfom a detailed eye exam on 2500 HCHS/SOL participants from Chicago and Miami aged ≥40 years to coincide with Visit #3. The HCHS/SOL Coordinating Center will provide direction in oversampling older adults to maximize disease detection efficiency, with sampling weights reflecting probabilities of selection to maintain accurate prevalence rates. Latinos of diverse backgrounds as in HCHS/SOL represent a rich sociocultural and genetically admixed group, inheriting a mixture of European, Native American, and African ancestry from populations previously isolated. As such, the HCHS/SOL Eye Study will represent the first highly admixed eye epidemiology cohort. This heterogeneity and intrinsic variability, essential in basic and clinical research, innovatively positions the HCHS/SOL Eye Study to assess important etiologic pathways amid prevalent risk factors and outcomes that cannot be assessed with homogenous cohorts. We propose to collect high-quality eye outcome data, identical to National Eye Institute (NEI)-funded population-based cohorts, which will allow the eye epidemiology community to, for the first time, assess novel hypotheses associated with systemic disease in a well-characterized, diverse cohort. The HCHS/SOL Eye Study is designed to 1) assess and compare the 2010 age-standardized prevalence of chronic eye disease across Hispanic/Latino groups using previously constructed HCHS/SOL “genetic analysis groups” (Mainland: Mexicans, Central and South Americans; and, Caribbean: Cubans, Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans); and, 2) assess whether prevalent disease is associated with novel CVD, biomedical, and sociocultural risk factors.

5R01AA030255-02,Hepatic Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase (NNMT) as a Pathogenetic Mechanism and Therapeutic Target for Alcoholic Liver Disease,"Despite much progress, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains a major health problem worldwide. The disease process is characterized by early steatosis, steatohepatitis, with some individuals ultimately progressing to fibrosis/cirrhosis and liver failure. Unfortunately, there is currently no accepted therapies available to halt or reverse this process in humans. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) catalyzes SAM-dependent degradation of nicotinamide, a predominant precursor for cellular NAD+ biosynthesis via a salvage pathway. SAM (s-adenosylmethionine) is the first product of methionine metabolism and a universal methyl donor in cellular transmethylation reactions. The critical role of NNNT in regulating both NAD+ and SAM homeostasis make it an emerging novel metabolic regulator. We are the first to report that the liver ATF4 transactivation plays a mechanistic role in mediating NNMT upregulation in the setting of chronic alcohol consumption and adenoviral shRNA knockdown of NNMT is protective against alcoholic fatty liver development, suggesting that NNMT can be an ideal therapeutic choice for ALD treatment. The preliminary data recently obtained from our laboratory uncovered that NNMT inhibition was associated with improved mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and blunted hepatic PPAR-gamma activation upon chronic alcohol exposure. In this proposal, we will further elucidate the mechanistic implication of NNMT in the pathogenesis of ALD. Successful performance of the studies proposed in this proposal will not only shed new light on the pathogenesis of this disease, but also pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions for ALD. The three aims are included in this proposal to test our hypothesis: AIM 1: To delineate mechanism(s) underlying NNMT-associated liver pathologies in ALD. Both animal and cell culture studies will be conducted to elucidate mechanism by which NNMT inhibition improves UPRmt elicitation in the liver and to determine the mechanism whereby NNMT upregulation contributes alcohol-induced liver PPAR-gamma activation. AIM 2: To elucidate mechanism(s) by which chronic alcohol consumption leads to hepatic ATF4 activation and NNMT upregulation. Both hepatocyte- specific Gcn2 knockout mice and hepatocyte-specific arginase-1 overexpressing mice will be fed with isocaloric control or alcohol-diet for 5 weeks. Targeted metabolomics will be conducted to using primary hepatocytes to quantify the effects of alcohol on hepatic arginine metabolism. AIM 3: To determine both preventive (the pathogenic role) and therapeutic potential of NNMT-targeting approach for ALD. Animals with liver-specific NNMT knockout will be exposed to either isocaloric control or alcohol-diet.

5R01EB027769-04,Transfontanelle photoacoustic imaging to study pathophysiology of neonatal braininjury,": Preterm and/or low birth weight neonates are at high risk for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with an incidence of 30%-35%. Complications result in shunt dependence and long-term changes: post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, periventricular leukomalacia, gliosis, and neurological dysfunction. ICH has many causes: traumatic delivery, primiparity or extreme multiparity, and low gestational age at birth. Early detection, classification and diagnosis of ICH is essential to reduce brain injury which often leads to motor (e.g., cerebral palsy), visual or cognitive dysfunction. TransFontanelle Ultrasound Imaging (TFUSI) is a routine diagnostic brain imaging method for infants younger than 6 months, whose skull bones have not completely fused together and have openings between them; so-called ‘fontanelles’. TFUSI is widely used due to its low cost, safety, accessibility, and noninvasive nature. Nevertheless, the accuracy of TFUSI is limited; TFUSI does not detect hemorrhages smaller than 5 mm and does not accurately detect blood in CSF. The low sensitivity of TFUSI to bleed size, location and duration may lead to autopsy findings that reveal conventional TFUSI underdiagnoses ICH in 8–34% of cases. Second stage diagnostic tools like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to study neonatal intracranial hemorrhage, however, all require moving clinically unstable newborns out of the NICU, sedation with its associated risks (hypotension, hemodynamic changes, or allergic reaction), and have high cost. Moreover, CT uses ionizing radiation and PET requires a positron-emitting radionuclide. Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) has poor spatial resolution, especially for the small neonate head, and poor penetration depth. To address several limitations of current clinical neuroimaging, we have developed a novel TransFontanelle Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging (TFMPI) method to study pathophysiology, and to improve the detection of brain hemorrhage in neonates without the need for sedation, radiation or radionuclides. Our ex vivo preliminary results show the surpassing capability of TFMPI in detection and quantification ICH earlier, with higher sensitivity and specificity than US; and, maps brain perfusion similar to MRI. This technique allows earlier diagnosis and treatment which may circumvent neural complications, and improve functional outcomes from cerebral palsy and cognitive impairments. The long-term goal of this research project is to provide a single, cost-effective, portable, point-of-care diagnostic screening for neonates with potential ICH. Studies outlined in the four aims of this proposal assess the feasibility of TFMPI for detection of ICH in a large animal model, similar in size to a human neonatal brain, with a surgically-induced cranial window that serves as a model for neonate’s fontanelle. Aim 1: To determine the lower limits of sensitivity of TFMPI to detect blood in CSF and its age. Aim 2: To detect intraparenchymal hemorrhages and their age. Aim 3: To measure the brain tissue oxygen saturation.

5R01DC019953-03,Synaptic Physiology of the Vestibular Periphery,"Project Summary. Vestibular afferent responses deviate from the coherent mechanical stimulation imparted by their overlying accessory structures. This implicates further processing by hair cells (HCs) and primary afferent conductances, and by afferent and efferent synapses. Processing is complicated by the parallel modes of transmission between HCs and afferents, and the convergence of multiple HCs onto single afferents. Type I HCs are enveloped by an afferent calyx, creating a restricted volume in the cleft between them. Type II HCs synapse onto the external face of a calyx and/or onto bouton endings via relatively small contact areas. This results in three types of HC-to-afferent convergence. In the simplest form, HCs converge onto an afferent solely at bouton endings. Increased complexity is found at calyces, including both simple calyces enveloping one HC and complex calyces encompassing two or more HCs. The highest complexity occurs at dimorphic endings that receive input from both HC types through a combination of bouton and both inner- and outer-face calyceal synapses. Prior studies have shown that for calyceal endings, rapid excitatory quantal transmission via glutamatergic AMPA receptors may be modulated by K+, H+, and Ca2+ accumulation. Dynamic changes in cleft ion concentrations occur in response to HC or afferent depolarization. These in turn impact responses in both the type I HCs and their afferents due to changes in the conductances and equilibrium potentials facing the cleft. As a result, properties of inner-face calyceal contacts differ significantly from those of HC and afferent conductances bathed in the bulk perilymph. For that reason, prior single-electrode biophysical experiments on HCs or their afferents in situ, or on isolated cells, have been unable to distinguish the contributions of HCs and afferents resulting from reciprocal interactions created by the unique volume of the synaptic cleft coupling the two. In this project, biophysical and morphological experiments will be performed on HC and afferent synaptic pairs in the posterior semicircular canal crista ampullaris of the red-eared turtle, T. scripta elegans, taking advantage of our unique ability to record simultaneously from both a HC and the afferent it contacts. This approach will be used to characterize the ionic environment of the synaptic cleft, the biophysical properties of HC and afferent conductances under conditions where the membrane potentials of a HC and its associated afferent are controlled simultaneously, and the structural elements responsible for these properties. The project has two major aims: (1) to contrast the biophysics and morphology of synaptic inputs from type I HCs onto the internal face of the calyx with those from type II HCs onto the calyceal external face and/or bouton endings of nearby branches, and examine their modulation by accumulation of ions and potential transmitters; and (2) to identify the mechanisms, modulators, sites of action and regional differences in nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic efferent input to type I and II HCs and calyx afferents across the crista. Overall, this project will provide an integrated structural, functional biophysical characterization of peripheral vestibular signal processing.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3289,492,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5K01MH128524-02,Leveraging Implementation Science and Design Methods to Sustain Community-Based Mental Health Services for Refugees,"There has been an unprecedented increase in the number of refugees worldwide, with approximately 26 million men, women and children forcibly displaced from their homes at the end of 2019. More than half of the world’s refugees live in dense urban areas or refugee camps in low- and middle-income countries. A smaller percentage are permanently resettled in high-income countries. Across these contexts, refugees have elevated rates of common mental disorders. War and forced migration also contribute to systematic disruptions in social relationships including family separation, tension and conflict, and losses of social networks. There is an emerging evidence base of models regarding refugees’ mental health and psychosocial needs, but major gaps exist regarding how to adapt evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to refugee populations and sustain them in community settings. To address these gaps, my career goal is to establish an independent research program focused on the implementation of community-based mental health services for refugee communities across the displacement continuum. In collaboration with community partners, I aim to examine methods for integrating EBIs into non-traditional service settings to enable refugees’ access to prevention and care interventions that promote positive mental health outcomes. A central concern my research seeks to address is how to best mobilize social and family resources to enhance coping and wellbeing. These research priorities are shaped by my more than fifteen years of clinical practice experience working with war-affected populations in the U.S and globally, doctoral training at the University of Chicago and early research experiences. This K01 application is structured to build upon my strengths and develop new knowledge and skills in key areas needed to achieve my long-term goals. My training aims focus on 1) implementation science methods to adapt, scale up and sustain EBIs in community settings; 2) the application of human-centered design to community-based refugee mental health services; and 3) community-based trial design and analysis. With support from an accomplished multidisciplinary team of mentors, I will apply these skills to a research project that focuses on implementing a peer-led multiple family group (MFG) prevention intervention called CAFES in two community-based organizations in Chicago to promote uptake and meet the multi-level needs of refugee families. Using a pilot randomized type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness design, the research aims include: 1) Adapting the multiple family CAFES model for Syrian refugee families and delivery by peer providers in community-based organizations using the ADAPT-ITT framework and human-centered design methods; 2) Piloting the adapted CAFES model to assess implementation science domains; and 3) Exploring changes in mental health outcomes and family and community support and mechanisms of change. Drawing on the new knowledge and skills and pilot study data obtained from this K01, I will prepare an R01 proposal to further test the model implementation and effectiveness.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3126,456,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R21HD107460-02,Development of a digital decision support tool to facilitate developmentally appropriate adolescent contraceptive counseling in primary care,": Contraceptive counseling is the process by which a health professional educates a person about their contraceptive options, including efficacy, proper use, and side effects, and helps them choose their optimal method. However, contraceptive counseling as typically implemented in primary care settings is not developmentally tailored to adolescents’ unique sexual, cognitive, and social development, resulting in suboptimal patterns of use and negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes that disproportionately impact vulnerable communities and perpetuate a cycle of health and economic disadvantage. Further, adolescents, particularly youth of color, have reported feeling coerced by providers to choose and continue a long-acting method. Although rates of adolescent pregnancy and childbearing have declined steadily over the past two decades, adolescents in the U.S. continue to experience disproportionately higher pregnancy and childbearing rates than their counterparts in other high-income countries. Racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minority youth have particularly high rates of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Adolescents’ pregnancies are much more likely than adults’ to be unintended. Children of adolescent mothers are at elevated risk of negative birth outcomes, physical and mental health difficulties, and of becoming teenage parents themselves. Individuals who first give birth as adolescents experience lower educational and economic attainment across their lifetimes. Further, rates STIs are rising among US adolescents. Without timely treatment, STIs can result in serious lifelong health problems, including risks of cancer, chronic pain, and infertility in adulthood. The long-term goal of our research is to tailor adolescents’ contraceptive counseling experience in order to improve contraceptive satisfaction, continuation, and consistent use, reduce experiences of coercion, and reduce unintended pregnancies and STIs. In this project, we will work with youth of diverse racial/ethnic and sexual/gender identities to create a digital decision support tool to assess adolescent knowledge, concerns, and preferences on contraception prior to the visit, then deliver the information to the provider to facilitate a focused, developmentally appropriate contraceptive counseling session. Specifically, we will identify the features of a digital decision tool deemed necessary by youth to facilitate their contraceptive decision making and by primary care clinicians to feasibly and effectively implement in primary care visits. We will design the tool and optimize its usability. This project will yield the necessary data for a future R01 application supporting a clinical trial of the tool.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2753,377,1.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R01EY034508-01A1,DECON: A sustained topical delivery platform to treat ocular inflammation,"Ocular inflammatory diseases are the primary cause of blindness in the USA. While emergence of ocular inflammation can be genetic or idiopathic, pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses that infect the eye are primary causes. Microbial infections are treated with antimicrobials followed by anti-inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone, prednisone, cyclosporine etc. The treatment regimen for these anti-inflammatory drugs is prolonged and can last up to many months or even years. While systemic dosing is often avoided unless necessary, topical dosage regimens can have low patient compliance due to repeated administration requirements per day. One such ailment that affects millions of people around the globe is ocular herpes. Primary infections are usually seen in children or adolescents and associated with vesicular dermatitis, follicular blepharo-conjunctivitis, superficial punctate keratitis (SPKs) or dendritic ulcer with preauricular lymphadenopathy. However, herpesviruses can reside forever in the host latently and cause recurrent ocular infection in patients of all ages. While the most common treatment for treating active ocular herpes infection includes daily dosing of Acyclovir (ACV) or ACV analogs, curbing post viral inflammation, which can cause ocular pain and permanent clouding of the cornea, is performed by topical glucocorticoid treatments such as prednisone or dexamethasone. These topical glucocorticoid therapies are avoided during active viral replication and only prescribed in conjunction with oral antivirals to avoid the risk of involving deeper stromal structures with threats to vision. While topical glucocorticoid treatments are effective in reducing inflammation in most cases, they require repeated dosing (6-10 times daily) and suffer from poor ocular retention. A simple yet effective way to improve ocular retention time for topical therapies is to use sustained drug release platforms. We have recently shown that ACV loaded into highly porous activated carbon termed as drug encapsulated carbon (DECON), can effectively adsorb to the corneal surface and deliver drug in a sustained fashion. We showed that use of DECON to deliver ACV, reduced the dosage frequency from 3 in a single day to a single dose once every alternate day in mice. In this regard, we propose to demonstrate a new use for DECON as a sustained drug release platform to deliver dexamethasone during post viral inflammation period. In this proposal, we would like to (1) understand the efficacy of drug loading, retention and release of dexamethasone from DECON using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models and (2) through clinically relevant metrics assess DECON’s ability to reduce infectious and non-infectious suppress inflammation during post viral replication period.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2797,413,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1K23MH130724-01A1,Improving Brain-Behavior Markers of Preschool Executive Function through aGroup-Based Parenting Intervention for Low-Income Families,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Impairments in executive functioning (EF), cognitive processes that support self-regulation, disproportionately impact children living in poverty and increase vulnerability for childhood disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs; oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), which trigger a cascade of mental health problems and psychosocial difficulties across the lifespan. Poverty-related stress and maladaptive parenting styles have been linked to alterations of neural and behavioral EF markers in children; despite this, no studies have studied if parenting prevention programs can directly target childhood EF, and through improving EF, reduce disruptive behaviors in at-risk children. This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award application seeks to conduct a mechanistic randomized clinical trial to determine whether neural-behavioral indices of childhood EF is an experimental therapeutic target that can be modified via caregiver participation in the Chicago Parent Program (CPP; Aim 1). Consistent with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria framework, childhood EF will be assessed across multiple levels of analysis (electroencephalogram [EEG], behavior, survey). The project also seeks to evaluate whether increases in childhood neural-behavioral EF mediate the effects of CPP in reducing disruptive behavior problems over a short-term follow-up (Aim 2). The project will also explore whether increases in specific parenting practices (discipline, scaffolding), previously linked to individual differences in EF, mediate the effects of CPP in predicting change in childhood neural-behavioral EF (Aim 3). The sample will include 90 Medicaid eligible parent-child (ages 4-5 years old) dyads; and will employ a novel recruitment approach where the target child will have moderate-to-severe EF delays at baseline but does not meet diagnostic criteria for a DBD. Consistent with the candidate's translational clinical scientist career goals, the candidate seeks crucial training in: community-based research and dissemination and implementation science, advanced EEG methods to evaluate neural-behavioral EF targets of preventive interventions, and statistical skills to design and evaluate clinical trials. Training will occur in an outstanding interdisciplinary environment at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in the Department of Psychiatry and leverage the department's established strengths in community mental health services research, dissemination and implementation science, and affective neuroscience. Mentors Drs. Atkins, Fitzgerald and Bhaumik and consultants Drs. Klumpp, Wakschlag, Gross, and Handley have expertise in the training areas and extensive histories of early career mentorship, and will work together to ensure the candidate's successful transition to research independence. Study findings will support an R01 application to validate the results on a larger scale and launch the candidate's academic career as a preventive intervention scientist. Findings have significant potential to identify whether CPP, a cost-efficient parenting intervention, modifies neural-behavioral EF indices in urban poor children, a theorized etiological risk mechanism of DBDs, and therefore prevent DBDs.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3265,437,1.0,False,False,0.07142857142857142,phase2_nih
5F31DA057064-02,Affective and Neural Correlates of Nicotine and Cannabis Co-Use in Young Adulthood,"Co-use of tobacco and cannabis is increasingly prevalent and may be associated with greater physical and psychological risks when compared to use of either substance alone. Co-use is particularly prevalent in young adulthood, an age group where risk for problematic substance use is heightened. Despite growing rates of co-use in this age group, factors that may maintain co-use are less well known. Individual differences in positive affect response to drug use and neural reward reactivity are important predictors of drug use maintenance, but are relatively understudied in this population. Thus, the specific aims of the proposed study are to 1) Characterize subjective positive affect response to cannabis and nicotine co-use, as compared to single- use of either substance 2) Investigate relationships between non-intoxicated neural reward reactivity and positive affect response following episodes of cannabis, nicotine, and co-use, and 3) Examine rates of cannabis and nicotine use in the past month as potential moderators of the relationship between non-intoxicated neural reward reactivity and positive affect change following drug use. To address these aims, the current study proposes to recruit a subset of participants from a large-scale ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study of young adult cannabis and tobacco co-users to participate in an additional electroencephalogram (EEG) laboratory visit. These study aims support the applicant’s training goals to 1) develop knowledge in phenotypes of concurrent substance use through investigating affective, neural, and behavioral correlates of nicotine and cannabis co-use 2) acquire training in EMA methods and data analysis 3) gain training and experience in EEG methods 4) pursue academic professional development through authoring manuscripts, conference presentations, and career development and grant writing seminars and workshops, and 5) gain training in ethics and responsible conduct of research. The applicant’s mentorship team is comprised of experts in young adult nicotine and cannabis use research and EMA methods (Dr. Mermelstein), affective and neural correlates of cannabis use in young adulthood (Dr. Crane), EEG methods and analysis (Dr. Burkhouse), and advanced statistical methods (Dr. Hedeker). The mentoring team will thus advance the applicant’s goals to pursue training in concurrent substance use research, EMA methods, and EEG methods. The proposed training and research plan ultimately supports the candidate’s long-term goal of pursuing a career as an independent investigator dedicated to understanding affective, behavioral, and neural correlates of concurrent substance use in young adulthood. Further, the proposed study has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of correlates of affective and neural correlates co-use in young adulthood that can be harnessed as future prevention and treatment targets.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2917,418,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01EY031350-04,Anti-VEGF-mediated barrier closure,"This project’s long-term goal is to elucidate how anti-VEGF (i.e. acute neutralization of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)) stops leakage of blood vessels that are chronically exposed to excess VEGF. Anti- VEGF’s ability to curb blood vessel permeability has improved and/or sustained the quality of life of patients afflicted with pervasive, incurable diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Such clinical observations demonstrate anti-VEGF’s efficacy, and beg the question of how anti-VEGF calms pathological blood vessels. We posit that chronically elevated VEGF alters gene expression in the endothelium of blood vessels in a way that relaxes the endothelial barrier, and that anti-VEGF reverses such changes. Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that anti-VEGF acts transcriptionally to close the barrier. Our preliminary data reveal that prolonged exposure to VEGF changes the expression of many genes, including those that encode known regulators of the endothelial cell barrier. These discoveries support our work hypothesis that anti-VEGF acts transcriptionally to close the barrier. This hypothesis will be tested as follows. The initial, RNAseq-based phase will compare the gene expression profile in cells that have or have not been treated with anti-VEGF and thereby identify anti-VEGF differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Candidates DEGs will be prioritized based on their known function, and then their contribution to VEGF-/anti- VEGF-mediated control of barrier function will be determined. We will identify genes that anti-VEGF depends on to close the endothelial cell barrier that has been breached with VEGF. Aim 2. Investigate the mechanism of action of anti-VEGF on patient-derived retinal endothelial cells. Aim 1 will be done with primary human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) from a healthy adult donor. Aim 2 will be a repeat of aim 1, except using PRECs, retinal endothelial cells isolated from pathological blood vessels that develop in patients with PDR. This is the target cell type of anti-VEGF therapy. Determining the mechanism of action of anti-VEGF in these cells will provide clinically relevant information. Aim 3. Determine how anti-VEGF calms pathological blood vessels in patients. In aim 3 we will learn how anti-VEGF acts in patients by comparing the gene expression profile in freshly isolated endothelium from pathological blood vessels of treatment naïve and anti-VEGF-treated patients. In addition, we will compare the results from all 3 aims to determine which of the anti-VEGF-mediated effects that occur in patients are faithfully modeled by anti-VEGF treatment of cultured PRECs (aim 2) or HRECs (aim 1). This project will unveil the molecular mediators of anti-VEGF’s therapeutic benefit. Such information will remove current roadblocks to developing biomarkers and alternatives to anti-VEGF, which are needed to address the needs of patients afflicted with a variety of blinding conditions such as DME, PDR and nAMD.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3076,454,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5K08DE030634-02,"Diabetes, Macrophages and Bone Regeneration","Both soft and hard tissue wound healing are impaired in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Diabetes negatively impacts fracture healing, bone regeneration and osseointegration of endosseous implants. The complex physiological changes associated with diabetes are often manifest in immunological responses to wounding and repair where macrophages play a prominent role in determining outcomes. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that the immune system is tightly linked to bone physiology and immunomodulation of bone repair is affected by key interaction involving macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Yet, a fundamental knowledge gap exists with respect to the nature of and the mechanisms that govern this interaction in the presence of T2DM. My recent published study has revealed that the conditioned medium from diabetic mouse macrophages impairs osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. My studies also show that macrophages secrete phenotype-dependent extracellular vesicles (EVs) that affect the level of bone repair. Here, I hypothesize that diabetic macrophage EVs mediate specific paracrine control of osteogenesis. To test this hypothesis, I propose two independent but thematically related aims. In Aim 1, I will characterize and compare wild type mouse macrophage EVs (wtEVs) and diabetic mouse macrophage EVs (dbEVs) at the structural and functional level and define the effects of these EVs on MSC osteogenic differentiation quantitatively. I will demonstrate the role of macrophage miRNAs cargo on osteoinduction by interfering miRNA function in Argonaute 2 (involved in RISC complex formation and miRNA function) knockdown MSCs. In addition, I will validate that dbEVs contain miRNAs that negatively influence the process of osteogenesis by generating EVs from DICER (required for mature miRNA formation) knockout macrophages. In Aim 2, I will identify significantly distinct miRNAs in dbEVs, their target genes and signaling pathways involved in osteogenesis by bioinformatic approach. I will evaluate the functionality of these miRNAs on osteoinduction by utilizing mimics/antagomirs that increase or eliminate the effects of identified miRNAs. I will study selected target genes at the level of miRNA interaction to affirm the direct effects on gene regulation and downstream effects of these key miRNAs on osteoinductive pathways. Translationally, I will generate functionally engineered EVs (FEEs) by engineer the candidate miRNAs (promote osteogenesis) that rescue dbEV effects into MSC EVs. The FEEs will be characterized structurally and functionally in vitro. Further I will utilize calvarial bone defect model to evaluate the function of selected miRNAs within FEEs on bone healing in diabetic mice. Overall, these mechanistic studies will explore the significance of the macrophage EV-mediated immunomodulation that occurs between macrophages and MSCs in the context of bone healing in the presence of T2DM.

5R01EY029782-04,Sleep and Circadian Regulation in Diabetic Retinopathy: The Role of Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells and Melatonin Supplementation,"PROJECT SUMMARY Diabetes affects more than 30 million people in the United States, with 90-95% having type 2 diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, one of the most serious complications of diabetes, is the leading cause of blindness. While diet, exercise and medications have been cornerstones of diabetes treatment to control glucose levels, the influence of sleep and circadian regulation on metabolic control are increasingly recognized as potential targets of future preventive treatment strategies. Recent work discovered that there is a dysfunction of the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in patients with diabetic retinopathy. These ipRGCs are a crucial part of entraining (synchronizing) the circadian system, which influences melatonin secretion and regulates sleep/wake timing and metabolic physiology. Recent data indicate that individuals with diabetic retinopathy show abnormalities in ipRGC function and abnormal melatonin physiology. The novel hypothesis we propose to test is that ipRGC dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy leads to disturbances in sleep and circadian regulation, which further adversely affects their metabolic control and could accelerate disease progression. Further, we hypothesize that melatonin supplementation will disrupt this vicious cycle. The proposed study will comprehensively examine ipRGC function via pupillometry in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without diabetic retinopathy. These groups will provide a range of ipRGC function. Sleep duration and quality (via wrist actigraphy), at-home electroencephalography (EEG), polysomnography, nocturnal melatonin secretion (measured from urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin), circadian regulation (24-hour blood sampling for melatonin and cortisol) and standard metabolic outcomes (hemoglobinA1c, fasting glucose, 24-hour mean glucose levels from continuous glucose monitoring) will be the outcomes and examined as a function of ipRGC function. Then, patients with diabetic retinopathy will be randomized to receive nightly melatonin supplementation or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes will be assessed at the end of the study which include sleep as measured by actigraphy and circadian regulation as assessed by 24-hour hormone sampling. Glucose parameters will also be assessed (hemoglobinA1c, fasting glucose, 24-hour mean glucose levels from continuous glucose monitoring). The proposed study will advance our understanding of the relationship between ipRGC function and the nonvisual health of people with diabetes, and provide evidence of potential benefits of melatonin in patients with diabetic retinopathy. These data will be highly relevant given the current epidemic of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, and will inform potential therapeutic interventions, leading to improve disease outcomes in these patients.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2901,393,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01AI168362-02,Optimizing Ridaifen-B analogs as potential therapeutics for Ebola viruses,"Summary Ebola virus disease (EVD) is caused by an infection with a group of viruses within the genus Ebolavirus. There are at least five species of Ebolavirus, Ebola virus (Zaire, EBOV), Ebola Sudan (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Reston virus and Tai Forest virus (TAFV). Infections with these viruses can cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and nonhuman primates, and are associated with up to 90% mortality rates with EBOV. Because of the safety concerns, these viruses are designated as the biosafety level 4 agents. Currently there is no effective therapeutic treatments against Ebola virus infection and pathogenesis in humans. Thus the goal of this application is to develop GP-specific small molecule inhibitors as drugs which can be used prophylactically and therapeutically against EBOV and other Ebola virus infections. To achieve this, we screened an in-house library of small molecules, and identified numerous potent entry inhibitors against EBOV. We have identified a series of potent compounds and will use them as leads which will be chemically optimized and developed as an anti-Ebola virus therapy candidate. In this application, two specific aims are proposed: (1) structure- based optimization of the lead compounds, and (2) In vivo evaluation of the lead compounds against EBOV infection using animal models.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,1337,205,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1F31GM143822-01A1,Characterization of structural elements controlling Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage and single-turnover enzyme kinetics.,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system offers an extremely versatile genome editing technology by employing an RNA- guided endonuclease, Cas9. Originally isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes, this system has been adapted for use in a wide range of organisms and can be programmed to manipulate almost any site in the genome. While Cas9 is easy to reprogram, the efficiency of Cas9-mediated editing varies considerably across different genomic targets. Unlike other common bacterial endonucleases, Cas9 exhibits single-turnover kinetics where it forms a stable product complex and requires an external force to release the cut DNA. This persistent product state impairs access to the double-strand break by repair machinery and contributes to reduced genome editing efficiency. Despite an abundance of Cas9 structures, the structure of the product complex remains uncharacterized as previous studies were carried out under conditions that prevent DNA cleavage. As a result, our structural understanding of the entire Cas9 reaction cycle remains incomplete and insufficient to explain why Cas9 exhibits single-turnover kinetics. Our lab recently used cryo-EM to determine the structure of the catalytically active Cas9-sgRNA-dsDNA ternary complex and captured three distinct conformational states (pre- and post-catalytic, and product states). These structures provide new insight into the coordination of Cas9 domains throughout catalysis and reveal persistent Cas9-nucleic acid interactions in the product state. Guided by this new insight, we will expand upon these studies to define the major structural elements contributing to Cas9 catalysis and single-turnover kinetics. Using innovative in vitro kinetic assays and established structural analyses, we will investigate the structural features that control the rate at which Cas9 cuts and releases the targeted DNA. Using rational design in conjunction with random mutagenesis, we will engineer a multi-turnover enzyme capable of spontaneously releasing its cleaved DNA product. Using an in vitro genome editing assay and an in vivo -galactosidase assay, we will screen Cas9 mutants for an increased rate of DNA cleavage. We anticipate the proposed studies will not only advance our molecular understanding of the Cas9 reaction cycle, but also support the development of more efficient CRISPR/Cas9 technologies.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2350,337,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R34AT012078-02,Feasibility Trial of a Mindfulness-basedmHealth Intervention to Mitigate the Effects of Chronic Workplace Stress among Juvenile Justice Officers,"Juvenile justice officers (JJOs)—responsible for the over 1 million youth arrested each year in the U.S.—face exceptionally high chronic workplace stress. This stress is implicated in a constellation of adverse outcomes underpinned by emotion dysregulation: depression, anxiety, and workplace burnout. Importantly, JJO workforces are comprised heavily of Black/African American and Latinx employees, and these same groups face disparities in mental health symptoms and burnout compared with peers from other racial/ethnic backgrounds. Interventions that address the effects of chronic workplace stress among JJOs thus stand to yield meaningful public health benefit while helping redress health disparities. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) improve emotion regulation and reduce depression, anxiety, and burnout. JJOs express strong interest in MBIs, which can be tailored and delivered to employees during their workdays via mobile health (mHealth) technology. This project will adapt an MBI smartphone app for delivery to JJOs based on empirically-supported adaptation targets, and will conduct a feasibility clinical trial. It will build on parallel procedures and technology developed through a prior NIH award to adapt and test an MBI app for arrested youth, offering a unique, efficient, and cost-effective opportunity. The study will take place in Chicago Cook County, the 2nd largest juvenile justice system in the U.S., where the study team has conducted NIH-funded research for 18 years. To guide adaptation and implementation of the app, the team will conduct key informant interviews rooted in a theoretically-driven implementation science framework. Interviews will be held on both the individual (JJO) and organizational (leadership) levels. The team will work with professional programmers to translate the interview findings into a secure app adapted from existing source code. For the feasibility clinical trial, JJOs (n=50) will be individually randomized to use the adapted MBI app or an equally intensive control app daily for 30 days. In-app analytics will capture objective use of each app feature. An adaptive intervention design will be employed to engage non-users of both apps, whereby analytics data indicating non-use will trigger delivery of an enhanced engagement strategy (e.g., text messages encouraging use). Mental health symptoms and burnout among JJOs will be assessed at baseline, 1, and 6 months via self-report. JJOs will also complete 1-week “bursts” of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of their objective contexts and affective states at baseline and 1 month in order to capture the mechanistic target (i.e., emotion dysregulation) in the workplace. At 1 month, both JJOs and leadership will report on acceptability and feasibility via an in-depth, mixed-methods design. Completion of this study will develop building blocks for high-impact, large-scale trials that formally evaluate the adapted MBI app. The use of theoretically- driven implementation science principles coupled with mHealth technology will position the MBI app to be sustainable and scalable across diverse juvenile justice systems, improving the health trajectories of their frontline workers.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3215,463,1.0,False,False,0.09523809523809523,phase2_nih
5R01HL150848-04,Maternal Self-Regulation and Early Childhood Obesity,"PROJECT SUMMARY Young children are dependent on their parents to create family environments that support healthy weight, yet many parents do not consistently parent in ways that protect their children from obesity. Further, several interventions to improve parenting as a means to address early childhood obesity have struggled with parent engagement and adherence. In adults, poor self-regulation, or limitations in an individuals' capacity to regulate emotions, thoughts, and behavior, is a robust, yet modifiable, risk factor for obesity. Poor self-regulation may similarly interfere with parents' ability to parent in ways that support their children's healthy weight, but there are no robust data to directly support this conjecture. Further, while improving children's self-regulation has been identified as a promising method to address childhood obesity, we do not currently understand how parent and child self-regulation work together to impact children's growth. This lack of information precludes us from identifying whether targeting child self-regulation alone, parent self-regulation alone, or both together, may be the most effective means to prevent or treat childhood obesity. Our long-term goal is to identify strategies to sustainably improve parents' use of practices that support children's healthy weight. The objective of this study is to identify the interrelationships between mothers' self-regulation, their weight-related parenting practices, child self-regulation, and child adiposity from ages 3 through 5, a critical period for preventing the onset of long-term obesity. Our central hypothesis is that poor self-regulation impedes mothers' engagement in parenting practices that support children's healthy weight, leading to excessive gains in adiposity among young children. We also expect that in families where both mothers and children have poor self-regulation, mothers have even greater difficulty engaging in effective weight-related parenting, and children will experience the most rapid gains in adiposity. To test this central hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective cohort study enrolling a socio-demographically diverse sample of 300 mother/child dyads, collecting data 3 times over 2.5 years to address the following specific aims: (1) Identify relationships between mothers' self-regulation and weight-related parenting practices, (2) Identify relationships between mothers' self-regulation and changes in child adiposity, and (3) Identify how child self-regulation modifies relationships between mothers' self- regulation, weight-related parenting, and child adiposity. This project is conceptually innovative in its focus on mothers' self-regulation, its recognition of the dyadic interactions between mothers and children, and the use of rigorous methods to measure self-regulation and parenting. This research is significant because it will elucidate when, how, and among whom deficits in mothers' self-regulation contribute to their young children's obesity risk. There are known strategies to improve self-regulation and enhance behavior change among adults with poor self-regulation. Findings will provide essential guidance for the development of novel intervention approaches to target mothers' self-regulation as a mechanism to prevent and treat childhood obesity.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3321,456,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

Expansion of our Program will help alleviate the critical shortage of successful Pediatric Endocrinologists and Pediatric Physician-Scientists.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2461,334,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
7R01DK124469-06,Efficacy of sipIT Intervention for Increasing Urine Output in Patients with Urolithiasis,"Project Summary Kidney stones affect an estimated 8.8% of American adults and direct medical costs exceed $10 billion annually. Five-year recurrence rates for stones have been as high as 40% and a standard guideline for prevention is to increase fluid intake enough to produce > 2.5 L of urine daily. Meeting these guidelines reduces stone recurrence rates by 50-60% yet patients’ adherence to fluid intake guidelines is commonly below 50%. Usual care for preventing a recurrence involves education about increasing fluid intake and dietary changes; however, the low adherence rate indicates that many patients would benefit from additional support in adhering to fluid intake guidelines. The long-term goal of this research is to reduce the recurrence of painful and costly stones by improving patient adherence to fluid intake guidelines (secondary prevention). Digital technology offers the promise of increasing reach and supporting treatment adherence but, to date, that promise has not been fully realized in clinical trials of digital tools for supporting treatment adherence. In a series of six preliminary studies, we engaged patients in developing and testing a context-sensitive digital tool called sipIT, a just-in-time adaptive intervention to promote fluid intake and increase urine output. We learned that patients are open to using digital tools provided those tools are integrated with their lifestyle and sensitive to the changing contexts of their lives. The resulting intervention, sipIT, incorporates a novel semi-automated tracking system to trigger smartphone notifications with context-sensitive reminders to drink. The reminder system was informed by contemporary theories of habit formation to support behavior change in the eventual absence of the technology. In this application, we propose to answer question, “Does sipIT increase 24-hour urine output more than usual care over a 3-month period?” Urine output was selected as a proximal surrogate endpoint based on clinical guidelines for preventing recurrence of kidney stones. The specific aims of this project are (1) to evaluate the efficacy of sipIT vs usual care for increasing urine output in patients with a history of kidney stones, and (2) to identify biological and behavioral moderators of intervention effects on urine output (heterogeneity of treatment effects). We propose a two-arm randomized controlled trial to achieve these aims. Patients will receive either usual care + sipIT (intervention group) or usual care alone (control group). We will evaluate 24-hour urine output, urine supersaturations, and fluid intake habit strength at baseline and 1, 3, and 12 months after intervention. If successful, this research will lead to a cost-effective intervention that leverages consumer technology so it can be scaled for dissemination and implementation in clinical practice to reduce the burden and cost of stones. It advances NIDDK goals of preventing noncancerous urologic diseases and may be applied to support other dehydration-related health concerns (e.g., urinary tract infections, cognitive performance, heat stress, post-surgical hospital readmissions).",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3158,465,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R01AI183620-01,Role of the Hippo pathway in scleroderma pathogenesis,"Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a multi-system fibrotic disease characterized by hard, thickened (fibrotic) skin and involvement of multiple internal organs, significantly impacting morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The pathogenesis of SSc is complex, with contributions from genetic predisposition, striking female predominance, associated vascular alterations (vasculopathy), immune system dysregulation, and aberrant tissue fibrosis. Using single-cell sequencing, we have observed that both myofibroblasts and endothelial cells undergoing endothelial-mesenchymal transition (endo-MT) are the primary source of type I collagen in SSc skin and primarily interact with a subset of myeloid cells (LAMP3+ dendritic cells. We further identified Hippo signaling, an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway implicated in female-biased autoimmunity through the vestigial like 3 (VGLL3) transcriptional co-regulator, through both direct inhibition and siRNA targeting, as an upstream regulator of both fibroblast-to-myofibroblast and endothelial-to-endo-MT transition in SSc skin. This forms the basis of our central hypotheses that LAMP3+ DC – stromal cell interactions drive myofibroblast and endo- MT transition underlying fibrosis in SSc skin through modulation of Hippo signaling. We will address this hypothesis through three specific aims, with aim 1 to mechanistically dissect the role of the Hippo-signaling pathway in both endo-MTs and myofibroblasts, aim 2 to assess the role of the sex-biased transcriptional co- factor VGLL3, which regulates the Hippo pathway at the nuclear level, and aim 3 to address LAMP3+ DCs, which secrete pro-inflammatory mediators and is the primary immune cell subsets interacting with Endo-MTs and myofibroblast in SSc skin. This proposal will address a novel pathway in SSc pathogenesis, assess cross-talk with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic immune function, and assess the contribution of the sex-biased regulator VGLL3 in the process. Thus, this work may add to our understanding of SSc pathogenesis and the biological processes that drive the marked female bias observed in SSc.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2126,293,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01LM013894-04,A scalable service to improve health care quality through precision audit and feedback,"All health care delivery organizations measure care quality and outcomes, increasingly via electronic clinical quality measures 1 and dashboards 2,3. However, these organizations lack evidence-based strategies for putting their quality and outcome data to work to improve performance 4,5. The most common approach is audit and feedback (A&F), the delivery of clinical performance summaries to providers, which demonstrates potential for large effects on clinical practice 6–8. But A&F too often produces negligible effects 5,9, creating little more than distraction for providers who are fatigued by information chaos 9–11. As currently implemented, A&F is a blunt, “one size fits most” intervention. Each provider in a care setting typically receives identical metrics in a common format, despite a growing recognition that “precisionizing” interventions holds significant promise to improve their impact 12–15. A precision approach to A&F would prioritize display of information in the single metric that, for each recipient, carries the highest value for improving performance, such as when the metric's level drops below a peer benchmark or minimum standard for the first time, revealing an actionable performance gap 16–19. Furthermore, precision A&F would employ an optimal message format (including framing and visual displays 20–24), based on what is known about the recipient and the intended gist meaning being communicated, to improve message interpretation while reducing cognitive processing burden 25–28. Well- established psychological principles, frameworks, and theoretical mechanisms provide a knowledge base to achieve precision A&F 16–19,29–33. From an informatics perspective, precision A&F requires a knowledge-based system that uses psychological theory at its core, but which enables mass customization by giving precedence to configurable knowledge about recipients at the group and individual levels. A precision A&F service employs this knowledge as requirements (necessary characteristics for message acceptability) and preferences (the relative importance of message characteristics) to generate messages that are more likely than a “one size fits most” report to positively influence clinical decision-making and practice. An equally important informatics challenge is to enable widespread improvement through a service for precision A&F at scale. A scalable precision A&F service must function as infrastructure compatible with a wide range of computing environments and supporting a wide range of clinical domains. In his previous NLM K-award, the principal investigator developed and tested a prototype knowledge-based system for precision A&F in email messages in anesthesia care. Preliminary data show that provider preferences are not uniform, suggesting that a platform for computable knowledge is necessary to support scalable precision A&F. The Knowledge Grid platform, developed at the University of Michigan, has been shown to support “precisionizing” for clinical decision support systems 34–36. Based on our prior work, the proposed project will advance the creation of more general services for precision A&F, applying the service in anesthesia care as a demonstration domain.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3220,455,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01MH125857-04,Testing Adaptive Interventions to Improve PTSD Treatment Outcomes in Federally Qualified Health Centers,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects 6% of U.S. adults, yet is left untreated in 70% of affected individuals and up to 85% of low-income individuals. One third of the nation’s low-income individuals are treated in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which do not have the capacity to provide all their patients with first-line, evidence-based treatments for PTSD such as Prolonged Exposure (PE). To address this problem, the study team has developed a low-intensity intervention (PTSD Coach) and a medium-intensity intervention (PE for Primary Care: PE-PC) that effectively treat PTSD in low- resource settings. However, some patients will still require high-intensity treatments (e.g., Full PE) for sustained clinical benefit. Thus, there is a critical need to develop adaptive, stepped-care models to treat PTSD in FQHCs by combining efficacious treatments, based on response to initial lower-cost strategies. The long- term goal of this line of research is to improve access to efficacious PTSD treatments by implementing empirically-based stepped-care behavioral interventions in low-resource domestic settings. The overall objective in this proposal is to develop a stepped-care intervention for PTSD using a Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART). The central hypothesis is that beginning with a low- or medium- intensity PTSD intervention and then titrating intensity based on early indications of response will result in clinically-significant PTSD symptom reduction with parsimony of resources. The rationale is that stepped-care interventions for PTSD are scalable and less costly than static treatments, thereby improving efficiency. To accomplish the objective, this project will employ a SMART design with 430 adults with PTSD in six FQHCs. Participants will be initially randomized to PTSD Coach or PE-PC. After four weeks, early responders will step down to lower frequency interaction within their current treatment strategy. Slow responders will be re- randomized to either continue their current treatment strategy or step up to Full PE for eight weeks. The specific aims are to: (1) Test the effectiveness of initiating treatment with PE-PC versus PTSD Coach in reducing PTSD symptoms at 3 months (endpoint), 6-month follow-up and 9-month follow-up, and (2) Test the effectiveness of second-stage tactics (continue or step up to Full PE) for slow responders. Exploratory aims are to (A) Identify the optimal stepped-care treatment sequence; (B) Conduct cost-effectiveness analysis; (C) Identify key mediators/moderators of treatment response; and (D) Prepare for future implementation through process evaluation. This project will contribute to the field an empirically-based stepped-care intervention for PTSD. This contribution is significant because it will improve clinical practice for PTSD by establishing an effective treatment sequence that can be delivered in a scalable, sustainable manner. This proposal is innovative because it will use novel methodologies to help shift the current clinical paradigm of PTSD treatment from fixed, static, and hard-to-access treatment strategies to a dynamic, adaptive, and accessible approach.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3237,465,4.0,True,True,0.35714285714285715,phase2_nih
5F99CA284256-02,Inter-organellar communication in metabolic reprogramming of colorectal cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Colorectal cancers (CRC) are characterized as having a hierarchical organization requiring proliferating and de-differentiated stem cells to maintain tumor growth and progression. Cellular plasticity underlying colorectal cancer is essential for a process which occurs following selective pressures of the tumor microenvironment and chemotherapeutics. The colonic tumor microenvironment is characterized by extreme hypoxia due to the anoxic lumen. Hypoxia promotes metabolic rewiring, and such processes are utilized by cancer cells to support biosynthesis, cell survival and dynamic alteration in cell fates. A critical feature of cellular metabolism is organellar interaction and coordination, yet how these contribute to CRC plasticity, survival, progression and treatment response are unclear. Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS) are the most abundant inter-organellar interaction. I generated a panel of ERMCS reporter CRC cell lines, and through unbiased high content imaging and CRISPR screens, I have identified essential mechanisms required for ER- mitochondrial interactions in CRC. Moreover, I show a key role of tumor hypoxia in modulating ERMCS. Hypoxia inhibited mitochondrial complex III and IV to decrease ERMCS. Treating cells with the mitochondrial electron carrier, coenzyme (CoQ) rescued ERMCS suppression following hypoxia. I hypothesize that tumor hypoxia regulates ER-mitochondrial contacts (ERMCS) by altering mitochondrial respiration and CoQ redox for metabolic adaptation and survival. In aim 1 (F99 phase), I will focus on identifying the molecular mechanism of hypoxia dependent ERMCS inhibition and expand into in vivo models with our novel ERMCS reporter mouse model. During the K00 phase, I will apply knowledge gained during graduate school in cancer metabolism and organellar interaction to an independent postdoctoral project. The plasticity of colorectal tumor epithelium depends on integration of organellar functions to sustain metabolic demands. Therefore, my goal as a postdoctoral fellow is to understand the dynamic changes and requirement for organellar interactions and metabolic compartmentalization during cell fates alterations in CRC. I plan to use genetic murine and primary patient organoid models of CRC, volumetric electron microscopy, in vivo organellar metabolomics, and functional CRISPR screens to answer these questions. Lastly, in addition to the proposed studies, this training plan includes activities important for career development, mentorship, networking, and scientific communication to prepare me for successful transition to a postdoctoral fellowship and my career as an independent investigator studying cancer metabolism.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2727,372,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01MH132656-02,A Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation RCT of Virtual Interview Training for Autistic Transition-Age Youth,"Project Summary: Pre-employment transition services is federally-mandated by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (2014) to help prepare autistic transition-age youth for the workforce prior to existing high school. However, there are few evidence-based practices implemented within pre-employment transition services, which contribute to low employment rates among autistic transition-age youth. A limitation of pre-employment transition services is the job interview component, which utilizes teacher-led role-play training that lacks empirical validation, is resource-intensive, and does not adhere to best practices to train sustainable changes in behavior (e.g., repeated practice, scaffolding, token economy). Moreover, the autism community as voice the need for better job interview preparation. To fill this training need, our team (via R34 MH111531) partnered with the autism community to adapt Virtual Reality Job interview Training (VR-JIT, an internet-delivered job interview simulator with four levels of automated feedback with elearning job interview content) to meet the needs of autistic transition-age youth (now called Virtual Interview Training for Transition Age Youth (VIT)). Our subsequent randomized controlled trial demonstrated several aspects of VIT feasibility, including delivery by local teachers at five schools, training teachers as VIT implementers, and completing the pilot RCT (i.e., recruitment, enrollment, study completers). The results of this pilot study demonstrated that VIT was initially effective at improving job interview skills, job interview anxiety, and competitive employment within 6 months of completing VIT. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to conduct a fully-powered trial to evaluate the impact of VIT across approximately 16 schools via a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation RCT. Our specific aims are to 1) Evaluate whether pre-employment transition services (ETS) with VIT, as compared to ETS with an active control intervention (i.e., job interview didactics/elearning with a series of 3-5 minutes videos of employed autistic adults talking about their career pathways), enhances employment outcomes; 2) Evaluate mechanisms of employment outcomes and psychological distress by nine months post- randomization; and 3) Conduct a multilevel, mixed-method process evaluation to assess initial implementation outcomes (i.e., facilitators, barriers, scalability, and affordability of VIT implementation).",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2485,336,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5F32HD106679-03,Local Economic Conditions and Patterns of Family Instability and Complexity,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The economy and the family—two social institutions that strongly affect health and well-being in the US—have undergone profound change in the last half-century. The economy changed through the stagnation of male wages, declining manufacturing jobs and rising service sector employment, and increases in inequality. Simultaneously, US families experienced increases in instability (repeated changes in parental marital/union status) and complexity (families that exist outside the typical nuclear family structure) through the late 1990s, such that approximately 40% of children currently live in complex families. Local economic conditions, like income inequality, are linked with singular family formation behaviors, like nonmarital births. Yet, the relationship between local economic conditions and family instability and complexity remains unknown. The objective of the proposed research project is to assess how local economic conditions— unemployment rates, wage stagnation, occupational structure, and income inequality—are associated with patterns of family instability and complexity, identifying how these associations developed over historical time and vary by social location. Aim 1 will establish contemporary (1997-2017) patterns of family instability and complexity by local economic conditions. Aim 2 will assess how changes in local economic conditions are linked with changes in family instability and complexity over historical time, comparing three periods: 1969- 1975 (early family change), 1976-1996 (rapid family change), 1997-2017 (family change plateau). Aim 3 will assess variation by race and educational attainment in the associations between local economic conditions and family instability and complexity. The PI will use advanced quantitative methods—sequence analysis, demographic decomposition, spatial data analysis, and causal inference techniques—to address these aims, and the use of nationally-representative data will produce generalizable results. Collectively, the aims will generate rigorous evidence on (1) whether and how local economic conditions affect patterns of family structure change, and (2) which children are most likely to be exposed to family instability and complexity. These findings are relevant to population health because family instability and complexity compromise the health and well-being of parents and children. This research project is part of a broader, 3-year postdoctoral training fellowship at a top research university, supervised by a team of mentors with expertise in family demo- graphy and economic inequality. The training plan comprises: (1) substantive training in family demography, economic conditions, and economic inequality; (2) advanced quantitative methods training that will facilitate a career in population health-relevant research; and (3) professional development through increased research independence, grant writing, conference presentations, and networking. The training plan will prepare the PI to conduct innovative research on how social and economic conditions shape family structure trajectories across the lifespan, which has consequences for population dynamics and population health.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3205,430,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01EY034479-02,Vision Impairment in the National Health and Aging Trends Study,": At least 14 million people in the U.S. are blind or living with a vision impairment (VI), and the number affected is projected to double by 2050 due to aging and growth of the U.S. population. The majority of those with VI and blindness are older adults aged ≥65 years. Particularly in later life, VI is thought to be associated with a host of adverse outcomes, including dementia, admission to a long-term care facility, and even mortality. Nonetheless, rigorous and generalizable research on how risk factors impact vision and eye health, and how vision influences late-life outcomes has been limited due to a lack of data that: (i) is longitudinal; (ii) is representative of the U.S. population; (iii) contains objective assessments of visual function; and (iv) samples older adults. In the proposed project, we will address this barrier using newly collected vision data from the NIH-funded National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), an ongoing nationally representative panel study of >7,000 adults aged ≥65 years. In 2021, NHATS began annual measurement of distance and near visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. In Aim 1 of the proposed study, we use NHATS data to provide the first-ever estimates on the incidence of VI and blindness at the national level, as well as national prevalence estimates. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the longitudinal influence of risk factors on vision health. To do so, we will utilize individual-level indicators of risk factors from NHATS and neighborhood level-indicators from the NIH-funded National Neighborhood Data Archive that is linked to NHATS. In Aim 3, we will investigate the longitudinal impact of VI and blindness on the development of dementia, placement in long-term care, and all-cause mortality. In a sub-aim, we will use a longitudinal mediation model to test whether the influence of key risk factors on adverse late-life outcomes is mediated by vision and eye health. To date, it has not been possible to carry out nationally representative studies on the associations of VI with risk factors and key late-life outcomes due to the lack of longitudinal and objectively measured visual function data in a national sample. Thus, the proposed studies will address critical scientific gaps. This proposal is also highly responsive to the National Eye Institute’s new 5-year Strategic Plan, including: (i) to gather current epidemiologic data; (ii) to support research at the nexus of risk factors and the healthcare system; and (iii) to explore research encompassing comorbidities. Epidemiological estimates will be made publicly available, and all study findings will be widely disseminated to maximize the impact of these studies on public health and to optimize vision and overall health and wellbeing for an aging U.S. population.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2795,444,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

5F31NS127551-02,PRC1-dependent H2A Monoubiquitination During Human Corticogenesis,"PROJECT SUMMARY Intellectual disability affects 2-3% of the population in industrialized nations, with genetic causes accounting for approximately half of these cases. Whole genome sequencing has led to the discovery of several novel pathogenic variants underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. Among these variants, proteins involved in chromatin post-translational modifications are highly represented. Variants in the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), the primary catalyst of histone 2A monoubiquitination (H2AUb1), illustrate this trend. RING1 and RNF2 are paralogues that serve as the constituent E3 ubiquitin ligase of PRC1, and missense variants in these genes that blunt H2AUb1 catalysis are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disability, and early onset schizophrenia. The goal of this proposal is to understand how pathogenic RING1 variants lead to disease genetically and molecularly. To explore the role of PRC1- dependent H2AUb1 in the context of human corticogenesis, we have generated isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines harboring pathogenic variants in RING1 and subjected them to neural differentiation to generate 3D cerebral organoids. Previous studies suggest that PRC1-dependent H2AUb1 has roles in transcriptional repression and double strand break repair. Consistent with these previous reports, our preliminary data demonstrates that the RING1G284A/G284A variant diminishes global H2AUb1 levels, leads to increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes and decreased growth in cerebral organoids, and disrupts double strand break repair in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Aim 1 will explore the genetic mechanism of RING1 pathogenic variants, as experiments will shed light onto whether pathogenesis is due to lost activity of wild type RING1 or due to a dominant negative effect of the mutant allele. Aim 2 will evaluate the molecular mechanism by which pathogenic RING1 variants cause microcephaly. Experiments will evaluate NPCs and organoids differentiated from hESCs harboring RING1 pathogenic variants for defects in DNA damage repair, increased rates of apoptosis, and the ability to silence transcription at sites of DNA damage. Mechanistic insights learned from these experiments will shed light onto the role of PRC1-dependent H2AUb1 in proliferating NPCs and in maintaining genome integrity more broadly. In addition, the results of these studies will inform future efforts to devise therapeutic strategies to restore these functions in individuals with pathogenic RING1 variants.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2582,361,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DK126451-03,Wnt Pathway Regulation of Gastric Stem Cell Function,"PROJECT SUMMARY This resubmission of a new R01 application proposes to define mechanisms of gastric stem cell regulation, investigating the role of Wnt signaling to maintain tissue homeostasis and to promote epithelial cell proliferation in the stomach. Our proposed studies are directly relevant to human disease, focusing on mechanisms of gastric polyp formation in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is a genetic disorder resulting from germline APC gene mutations that dysregulate Wnt signaling, with extreme gastrointestinal (GI) proliferative disease resulting from Wnt promotion of stem cell proliferation. Although Wnt is well known to regulate GI stem cells, questions remain regarding sensitivity to Wnt dysregulation in different regions of the GI tract. Colonic manifestations in FAP patients are extreme, with aggressive disease characterized by early adenoma and cancer development, which commonly leads to colectomy at a young age. The consequences of Wnt dysregulation in gastric stem cells is less well understood, although polyp, adenoma and cancer development are enhanced in the FAP patient stomach. Notably, almost all FAP patients exhibit frequent hyperproliferative polyps localized to the proximal fundic/corpus region of the stomach, while, in contrast, the distal antral/pylorus region of the stomach is relatively spared from these polyps and develops more occasional adenomatous growths. The basis for the regional effect of FAP mutations on corpus vs. antral stem cells and gastric tissue responses is unknown. To address this important question, this project focuses on defining Wnt regulation of gastric stem cells to uncover the differential effects of pathway activation in the proximal vs. distal stomach. We will pursue the mechanisms of FAP polyp formation in the stomach by functional and genetic analysis of gastric polyp and non-polyp organoids and tissues from a biobank of human FAP gastric tissue samples that will be built as a component of this study. Human FAP organoid studies will be complemented by mouse genetic, pharmacologic and organoid models to gain deeper mechanistic insight into regional Wnt regulation of gastric stem cells. The studies are framed by the “Just Right Hypothesis” which defines differential sensitivities along the GI tract based on region-specific stem cell responses to different levels of Wnt activation. Together the proposed studies will determine how dysregulated Wnt signaling leads to differential gastric epithelial cell proliferation and polyp formation in proximal vs. distal stomach. This information will establish a scientific framework to help define the gastric manifestations in FAP patients. In addition, the studies will provide functional insights to develop a deeper understanding of Wnt pathway regulation of gastrointestinal stem cells. Furthermore, understanding mechanisms of Wnt pathway regulation of gastric stem cell function is important to refine strategies to propagate adult stem cells in culture for regenerative therapies as well as to develop diagnostic criteria and potential therapies for gastric hyperproliferative diseases.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3156,459,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R01DA058029-01A1,Improving Perioperative Care for Patients with Opioid Tolerance,"In the United States, nearly 1 in 6 adults filled an opioid prescription in the past year and 10 million adults are opioid tolerant. Compared with opioid naïve patients, individuals with opioid tolerance experience greater challenges in managing acute pain especially after having surgery and poorer outcomes following surgical care. For example, opioid exposure before surgery has been shown to lead to greater rates of opioid consumption after surgery. Further, patients with opioid tolerance frequently encounter high-risk prescribing practices and delays in returning to their usual prescriber after surgery, as well as greater rates of morbidity and mortality after surgery. Evidence-based care pathways have been developed to improve opioid prescribing before and after surgery for opioid-naïve patients, but little is known about the postoperative needs of patients with opioid tolerance. Specifically, important knowledge gaps exist regarding the appropriate amount of opioids to prescribe after surgery, best practices in coordinating opioid therapy during the perioperative period, and the effectiveness of care coordination pathways to prevent high-risk prescribing practices and optimize clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population. To address these gaps, we will prospectively capture patient-reported opioid use and pain outcomes among individuals with opioid tolerance undergoing common surgical procedures and develop a clinical care pathway to optimize outcomes across a large network of hospitals in the state of Michigan that are diverse with respect to geography and case mix. In 2016, we established the Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network (OPEN), a federal and state funded quality improvement program focused on developing and disseminating best practices in surgical opioid prescribing and pain management for opioid-naïve patients. In this proposal, we will extend this work to examine patient-reported pain outcomes and opioid prescribing practices after surgery among opioid tolerant patients in order to calibrate current prescribing guidelines for common general surgery procedures (Aim 1). We will then conduct qualitative interviews with surgical patients who have opioid tolerance; their providers; and healthcare leaders. This data will inform the development of a clinical care pathway for perioperative pain management for patients with opioid tolerance (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a prospective randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of the care pathway on coordinating care and reducing high-risk prescribing practices after surgery, length of stay, and readmissions, as well as optimizing patient-reported pain (Aim 3). We hypothesize that implementation of the care pathway will increase alignment with guideline-concordant prescribing without adversely impacting patient-centered outcomes. Given the high prevalence of individuals with opioid tolerance undergoing surgery each year in the United States, interventions to reduce high-risk prescribing practices, adverse postoperative events, and optimize postoperative pain management will lead to safer perioperative care.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3133,435,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DK116723-04,UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes,"PROJECT SUMMARY The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) and its observational follow up Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC) represent landmark achievements in diabetes research. The DCCT enrolled 1441 men and women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a randomized trial of intensive vs. conventional insulin therapy, delaying the onset and progression of diabetic complications and dramatically changing the management of patients worldwide. Implementation of tight glycemic control has reduced the frequency of devastating complications of T1D such as early death, blindness and amputation. Women and men with T1D face new challenges including cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction and urological disorders. UroEDIC, an ancillary study examining urological complications in the DCCT/EDIC cohort, combines over 25 years of detailed medical information and >90% participation in urological symptom assessment annually since 2010, making it the longest running most extensive urological evaluation of persons with T1D. The previous funding cycle identified lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary incontinence (UI) as urological disorders in men and women with T1D with the highest prevalence and greatest impact on quality of life (QOL). By linking powerful longitudinal urological phenotypes with extensive clinical and laboratory data of the DCCT/EDIC, we can substantially deepen our understanding of diabetes associated urinary complications. Preliminary analyses show that although many patients develop a fixed state of LUTS or UI, many others move in and out of the state over time. Our overall hypothesis is that metabolic, autonomic and epithelial dysfunctions are associated with persistent and reversible subphenotypes of LUTS and UI in men and women with diabetes. Observations also indicate bladder overactivity in both genders is increasing in this cohort. However, there is a lack of understanding of the burden and impact of other diabetic bladder problems, particularly diabetic cystopathy, classically described as decreased bladder sensation, poor contractility and high residual urine volume. The goals of UroEDIC Bladder, therefore, are to 1) characterize the full spectrum of bladder dysfunction in T1D, 2) create risk models that explain the progression and remission of LUTS/UI, and 3) identify mechanistic themes underpinning the persistence of these symptoms. The specific aims of this project are designed to incorporate newly proposed and available longitudinal data on bladder retention, autonomic dysfunction and novel transcriptional signatures with the full range of DCCT/EDIC measurements to gain deeper insight into the longitudinal patterns and mechanisms of LUTS/UI and comprehensively characterize diabetic bladder dysfunction in T1D.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2813,397,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

5R00DK123395-04,GPRASP family as novel regulators in hematopoietic stem cells,"Project Summary Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) represents the only curative therapy for most hematologic disease including leukemia. HSCT requires donor HSCs to engage with the proper supporting niche, survive, proliferate, and differentiate into mature blood lineages. Recent studies suggest that “stress hematopoiesis”, including that which occurs post-HSCT, is subject to distinct regulation compared steady-state hematopoiesis. A better understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate transplanted HSCs and their engraftment is necessary to improve HSCT, especially in situations where transplant is limited by small cell numbers (e.g. cord blood) or potentially compromised by ex vivo manipulation (e.g. gene therapy). Towards this, the main goal of this project is to identify and characterize novel key intrinsic regulators of HSCT. My work reveals high expression of multiple GPRASPs (G-Protein Coupled Receptor Associated Sorting Proteins) (e.g. Gprasp1 and Gprasp2) in HSCs, relative to downstream progenitors. I have also found that both GPRASP1 and GPRASP2 act as negative regulators of HSCT. Gprasp-deficient HSCs present enhanced homing, survival and quiescence during transplant. This phenotype appears dependent on Cxcr4, a master regulator of HSCs function, whose sequence contains a putative GASP-binding motif. Indeed, ectopic Cxcr4 enhances HSC homing, survival and quiescence during transplant, phenocopying loss of Gprasp1 or Gprasp2. Further, my preliminary studies show that, upon Gprasp1 or Gprasp2 loss, CXCR4 is stabilized and accumulates on HSCs, sensitizing them to SDF-1. CXCR4 has also been implicated in regulating cell-to-cell contact between B-cell progenitors and stroma cells. Interesting, my recent data suggests that GPRASP loss may also perturb B-cell production by blocking the differentiation of lymphoid progenitors. Finally, although HSCs as a population are highly enriched for Gprasp1 and Gprasp2 expression, my recent analyses of single cell gene expression data and single HSCs by immunofluorescence reveals that the expression of these genes is heterogeneous amongst individual HSCs. This differential expression corresponds with distinct gene expression profiles (e.g. stemness, cell cycle, B-cell differentiation). Although clonal analyses have revealed that even highly purified HSCs display diverse differentiation potential, the molecular regulation of this functional heterogeneity is currently poorly understood. Thus, I hypothesize that multiple GPRASP family members regulate HSC transplantation and B-cell differentiation, and correlate with HSC functional heterogeneity. The mentored phase of this proposal will occur at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, under Dr. Shannon McKinney-Freeman. In the independent phase, I will confirm and extend my studies of the molecular link between GPRASPs and CXCR4 in HSCT and B-cell differentiation, as well as exploit novel molecular reporters to refine HSC functional heterogeneity. The institutional resources and academic environment and the planned courses outlined in my proposal will ensure my successful transition to independence.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3168,435,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R35GM154671-01,Glucocorticoids in short- and long-term critical illness outcomes,"Because of the high mortality, morbidity, and health care costs associated with critical illness, identifying biological mechanisms that can be targeted to improve critical illness outcomes is an important public health priority. Glucocorticoid treatment has been frequently studied in critically ill populations and can improve short- term survival as well as long-term mental health outcomes. Full realization of the therapeutic potential of glucocorticoids in critical illness is hampered by gaps in our understanding of its mechanisms of action and by glucocorticoid resistance, which limits its efficacy. Our future research program will focus on the theme of glucocorticoid mechanisms relevant to critical illness, with three main objectives. First, our prior work led us to hypothesize that glucocorticoids improve mental health outcomes by enhancing factual memories from the ICU. We will test this hypothesis in a population of sepsis survivors from our hospital. Second, we propose a novel hypothesis about the importance of brainstem glucocorticoid signaling in the maintenance of cardiovascular and immune homeostasis. We will test the role of glucocorticoid receptors in this specific brainstem area in the response to acute hypotensive and inflammatory challenges using the tools and skills that we have acquired for neural circuit interrogation. Finally, we propose to test a novel strategy to improve peripheral and central glucocorticoid sensitivity in collaboration with a new industry partner. Over the past five years I have positioned myself as a multidisciplinary leader across critical care, endocrinology, and neuroscience. My laboratory’s experience in running a translational research program at this interface will lead to the identification of specific, targetable mechanisms to improve critical illness outcomes. Alongside these research goals, I will continue my work as a mentor for the next generation of scientists and physician-scientists. Because of the translational importance of our work and the inclusivity of our environment, my lab has become a sought-after environment for scientific trainees. During this funding period I will continue to grow as a mentor and leader, cultivating a collaborative and diverse group that reflects and prepares the next generation of scientists.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2318,337,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HD108253-02,The impact of hormonal modulation on systemic inflammation and central sensitization,". Chronic pelvic pain remains a challenging condition to treat, in large part because underlying disease mechanisms are poorly understood. Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP) is a common form of CPP wherein the severity of disease is only weakly associated with the degree of pain experienced. While pelvic inflammation is a well-established contributing factor to EAPP, we propose that low-grade systemic inflammation also contributes to the disease state by promoting central nervous system (CNS) sensitization. Emerging evidence from our group and others suggests that low-grade systemic inflammation can promote multiple aspects of CNS sensitization including clinical manifestations (comorbid pain conditions, widespread pain), hypersensitivity to experimental stimuli, and altered brain functional connectivity in pelvic pain. While hormonal suppression is effective for many women, and acts in part by dampening estradiol-dependent pelvic inflammation, little is known about the relative contributions of low-grade systemic inflammation and CNS sensitization to EAPP. We propose to use the FDA-approved, gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor antagonist, elagolix, available in two dosages, as a mechanistic probe to assess the effects of pelvic and systemic inflammation on EAPP. The presence of robust dose-dependent effects on EAPP and its comorbid symptoms suggests to us that the higher dose also reduces CNS sensitization, possibly due to reduced systemic inflammation. To investigate this hypothesis, we will conduct a double-blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial in which 200 women with EAPP will be randomly assigned to low-dose (150mg daily) or high-dose (400mg daily) elagolix or placebo with evaluation of pain mechanism outcomes prior to and after treatment. We will focus on two common patient phenotypes – those with EAPP only and those with EAPP and widespread pain (1:1 recruitment). In Aim 1, we will first define the relationship between pelvic inflammation, systemic inflammation, and CNS sensitization using well-vetted neurobiological measures of CNS sensitization. We anticipate that systemic inflammation will be associated with CNS sensitization, while pelvic inflammation will not be. In Aim 2, we will identify dose-dependent changes in CNS sensitization as well as systemic and pelvic inflammation during hormonal suppression for EAPP through the above-described clinical trial. We anticipate that both dosages will improve pelvic inflammation, but that systemic inflammation and CNS sensitization will be improved on high-dose elagolix. We furthermore anticipate that those with widespread pain will be more likely to respond to high-dose elagolix. In an exploratory Aim 3, we will determine if baseline levels of pelvic and/or systemic inflammatory activity, as well as CNS sensitization, predict the response to elagolix. These studies are critical to develop alternative mechanistic models of pain promotion and relief in this vulnerable group of patients and will have implications for understanding hormonal contributions to the female preponderance of chronic pain syndromes.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3140,445,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
4K00NS129171-03,Assessing the efficacy of NIR therapy to modulate shared secondary injury mechanisms in a murine model of ischemic stroke and porcine model of TBI,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading health concern for both children and adults worldwide. Similarities between pig and human brain anatomy, development, and neuroinflammatory response have brought attention to the domestic pig as a highly promising model animal for studying age-specific responses to mechanical trauma. To date, I have quantified baseline behavioral data in healthy Yucatan minipigs. For the duration of the training period, I will conduct a battery of behavioral tests to identify changes in behavior and physiology in juvenile pigs following a closed-head impact procedure designed to model pediatric concussion. In the postdoctoral phase, I plan to develop expertise in the development of novel neurointervention strategies in large animal models. To facilitate transition to a lab where I will need to utilize state-of-the-art imaging techniques to validate the efficacy of my treatments, I will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an assessment tool to quantify changes in neural structure and function in brain-injured pigs. I will receive comprehensive training in MRI data processing from experts in both human and pig neuroradiology.

5K08DK129719-03,Coordinated functions of ER quality control mechanisms in pancreatic islet α cells,"SUMMARY A central component of diabetes pathogenesis is dysregulated secretion of insulin and glucagon from b and α cells of the endocrine pancreas. Endocrine cells rely on protein quality control (QC) systems within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to clear misfolded proteins, maintain ER homeostasis and ensure hormone production. Misfolded proteins are removed in part through substrate-specific clearance by Sel1L-Hrd1 ER- associated degradation (ERAD), or bulk degradation of aggregates by autophagy. Our recent study showed that ERAD and autophagy regulate different aspects of β cell biology – maintenance of β cell identity and survival, respectively. Despite their shared importance in controlling glucose homeostasis, our understanding of α cell biology lags behind that of β cells. The mechanisms regulating ER homeostasis in (and thus, synthetic capacity of) α cells remain largely unexplored. To this end, mouse models lacking Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD or autophagy in α cells were characterized. Defective ERAD limited glucagon production and α cell mass, but did not impair systemic glucagon secretion in response to hypoglycemia. In contrast, defective autophagy in α cells disrupted ER homeostasis and impaired glucagon secretion in vivo. Intriguingly, our preliminary data points to potential crosstalk between these two QC machineries. Hence, this proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD and autophagy cooperate to ensure ER proteostasis in pancreatic α cells – which is critical for α cell identity, function and/or survival. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro genetic and pharmacologic approaches using mouse models, cell lines, and human islets, we will test the following Aims: (1) Demonstrate the pathophysiological importance of the interplay between ERAD and autophagy in α cells, and (2) Delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the crosstalk between ERAD and autophagy in α cells. This study will provide unprecedented insights into ER QC mechanisms in α cells, which may be harnessed to identify new therapeutic approaches to address α cell dysfunction in diabetes. This undertaking will build upon Dr. Reinert’s scientific expertise in developmental biology and physiology with training in two cutting-edge cell biology fields, ERAD and autophagy, with a focus on organelle crosstalk. Moreover, this study will strengthen Dr. Reinert’s technical skills by providing training in state-of-the-art cell biology techniques, thus paving a strong foundation for her future career as a physician scientist leading an interdisciplinary team studying islet cell biology and pathophysiology.

5F32CA260735-03,Targeting purine biosynthesis to radiosensitize glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive primary brain tumor and is uniformly fatal with a median survival of around 1.5 years. Like surgery and chemotherapy, radiation (RT) is a critical treatment for nearly every patient with GBM and has repeatedly improved patient survival in multiple randomized trials. Still, 80% of GBMs recur within the high dose RT field. Thus, there is a critical need to develop strategies to overcome GBM RT resistance to further improve patient outcomes. GBM cells exhibit profound cancer-specific metabolic abnormalities, including elevated purine synthesis, to fuel proliferation, invasion and survival. Using mice bearing intracranial orthotopic patient-derived brain tumors, my research has established that the metabolic phenotype of elevated purine synthesis also mediates resistance to RT in GBM by promoting the repair of RT-induced DNA damage. This purine-mediated RT resistance can be overcome by treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an FDA-approved and CNS-penetrant inhibitor of purine biosynthesis. In this research proposal I will determine how the RT response and purine synthesis regulate one another in GBM. By employing a variety of cutting-edge metabolomic techniques and patient-derived GBM models, I will 1) define the biosynthetic pathway GBMs use to generate purines, and 2) determine the RT response mechanism by which GBMs increase purine levels to resist RT-induced DNA damage. Findings from the experiments proposed here will expand our understanding of how tumors modulate metabolism to promote therapeutic resistance, inform how to combine metabolic inhibitors with standard therapies, and lay the mechanistic groundwork for clinical trials at the University of Michigan that targeting purine biosynthesis to augment RT in GBM patients.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,1809,263,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DK125792-03,Testing a very low-carbohydrate diet version of the Diabetes Prevention Program to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes,"One-third of U.S. adults have prediabetes and are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its devastating health consequences. The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) trial demonstrated that a resource- intensive, one-on-one program combining diet and physical activity changes, could reduce the 3-year risk of type 2 diabetes by 58% compared with usual care. Consequently, the DPP is considered one of the best examples of how a nutritional program can prevent disease, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others recommend the DPP as a first-line treatment for adults with prediabetes. The CDC’s National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) is an adaptation of the DPP trial curriculum, using group-based delivery. It teaches participants to follow a low-fat, calorie-restricted diet, as this was the prevailing dietary advice when the DPP trial was designed over 30 years ago. The NDPP is now available at >1,500 sites throughout the United States and reimbursed by Medicare and other payors. Yet, despite widespread availability, only 36% of participants achieve the program goal of ≥5% body weight loss and, when measured, HbA1c reduces on average less than 0.1%. We hypothesize that adapting the NDPP to teach a different dietary strategy—a very-low-carbohydrate diet (VLCD)—will increase the effectiveness of the NDPP as a tool for type 2 diabetes risk reduction. Carbohydrate intake is the strongest factor impacting post-prandial glycemia, and a VLCD—due to its ability to reduce glycemia, weight, and the need for anti-hyperglycemic medications—is now recommended by the American Diabetes Association for treatment of type 2 diabetes. To date, there are neither high-quality, randomized controlled trials testing how effective a VLCD is at reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes, nor randomized trials of VLCD versions of any DPP. To begin to fill this critical gap, our team has developed and pilot tested a VLCD version of the NDPP (VLC- NDPP), delivered by our CDC-recognized community partner, the National Kidney Foundation of Michigan. Our findings demonstrate that a VLC-NDPP is feasible and acceptable. We now propose to conduct a 12- month, 1:1, randomized trial that will assign 300 overweight or obese adults with prediabetes to either the standard NDPP or the VLC-NDPP. The primary outcome is glycemic control (measured by HbA1c), with secondary outcomes including body weight, body fat percentage, glycemic variability, and inflammation. We will also explore the barriers to and facilitators of glycemic control and dietary adherence using mixed methods. As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the understanding of personalized interventions continue to increase, there is a critical need to provide additional effective options for population-level type 2 diabetes prevention strategies. If the VLC-DPP shows promise, this trial would be a precursor to a multi-site trial with incidence of type 2 diabetes as the primary outcome.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3020,461,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DK123022-04,Manganese in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a family of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract that affect over 3 million Americans. While genetic background clearly plays a role, environmental factors, especially dietary nutrients, have been suspected as triggers to contribute to the disease development. Identifying the direct causal mechanisms by which genetics and dietary nutrients coordinately influence IBD susceptibility may provide direct utility in uncovering both how the disease develops and how it may be treated in the future. Although genetic factors appear to play relatively minor roles in IBD, there is one particular association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with IBD that showed up at the top of a recent genome-wide association screen in IBD: a common variant in the manganese transporter SLC39A8 (p.Ala391Thr). We and others have shown that this transporter is critical for the incorporation of manganese (Mn), a micronutrient required for many enzymatic activities. The SLC39A8 A391T variant was shown in vitro to have reduced Mn incorporating function, and we made similar observations independently. These revelations hint toward alterations in Mn levels caused by diet or genetics, as contributing factors for IBD. Yet, Mn deficiency has traditionally been rare in humans due to its various dietary sources. Mn is abundant in plant-based foods, including whole grains, rice, nuts, and leafy vegetables, whereas animal-based foods lack this nutrient. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed >40% reduction in dietary Mn consumption in the past 15 years due to a Western diet characterized by high intakes of red meats, high fat foods, and refined grains. This data is congruent with the increasing incidence of IBD, and it supports an inverse relationship between nutritional Mn levels and IBD patients. However, we still have not established if there is a causal role of Mn in IBD and the mechanism by which Mn contributes to IBD. This project will define functional insight into the roles of dietary Mn and SLC39A8 that maintain intestinal health, thereby advancing research into the etiology of IBD. Our findings will pave the way for future research in individuals at high risk of IBD to provide dietary recommendations and therapeutic targets.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2354,358,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5F31CA265085-02,Regulation and role of fibroblast-derived interleukin-33 in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly deadly disease with a five-year survival rate of only 10%. The bulk of the PDA tumor volume is composed of a reactive fibroinflammatory tumor microenvironment that assists in the growth and maintenance of the tumor. The highly immunosuppressive nature of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment is also responsible, in part, for the continued inefficacy of immunotherapy treatments in PDA patients. Despite numerous studies that have previously examined different facets of PDA immunosuppression, there is still much that is unknown regarding the complex network of intercellular crosstalk that regulates this phenomenon. Our previous work has demonstrated that infiltrating macrophages are essential mediators of immunosuppression in PDA, and that their polarization is affected by the expression of oncogenic Kras in tumor cells. Other groups have characterized the immunosuppressive impact of certain fibroblast subgroups within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Preliminary experiments described in this proposal demonstrate a connection between fibroblasts, macrophages, and tumor cells through fibroblast expression of the cytokine interleukin-33 (IL33). The role of IL33 in cancer biology is controversial, with its overall effect on the tumor thought to be supportive or suppressive depending on the cancer context. Here, results show that IL33 abundance correlates with disease progression and that fibroblast expression of IL33 is dependent on oncogenic Kras-driven signals from tumor cells. Additionally, we have completed a pilot experiment whereby we have orthotopically implanted pancreatic tumor cells into a syngeneic genetically engineered mouse model lacking Il33 in fibroblasts (Il33f/f, Pdgfra-CreERT2/+). Tumors from Il33-deficient mice had slower tumor growth and a trending decrease in macrophage infiltration, suggesting that fibroblast-derived Il33 is both tumor promoting and may play a role in the recruitment of immunosuppressive macrophages. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to elucidate the cellular interactions that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of immunosuppression in PDA, and the central hypothesis is that fibroblast derived IL33 is a key regulator of immunosuppression in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment through its modulation of macrophage infiltration. This hypothesis will be investigated through the following two Aims: (Aim 1) define the regulation and role of IL33 in cancer-associated fibroblasts, and (Aim 2) assess the impact of IL33 on the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. To complete this investigation, a combination of in vitro assays using tumor cell, fibroblast, and macrophage cultures will be performed. We also will continue to utilize the Il33f/f, Pdgfra-CreERT2/+ genetically engineered mouse model to assess Il33-dependent changes in the immunosuppressive nature of pancreatic tumors. The data accumulated by this study will further the field’s understanding of immunosuppression regulation in PDA, and consequentially bring effective immunotherapy strategies one step closer to becoming a viable therapeutic option.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3181,440,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

5R01DC018003-04,Noise-Induced Synaptic Loss and Vestibular Dysfunction,"Vestibular dysfunction is a significant public health problem. Agrawal et al. (2009) reported that 35% of adults older than 40 had evidence of postural instability. Balance dysfunction is linked to an increased likelihood of falling and in the U.S. falls are responsible for more than 50% of accidental deaths. Although the causes of vestibular dysfunction are multiple, recent studies suggest a linkage between noise-induced hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction (Akin et al. 2012; Golz et al. 2001; Guest et al. 2011; Zuniga et al 2012). The suggestion that noise exposure is also a risk factor for vestibular dysfunction is controversial as there is only limited experimental support for causal relationships between noise exposure and peripheral vestibular pathology and behavioral symptoms (e.g., poor balance). In our recently published study (Stewart et al. 2018), we exposed rats to 6 hours of 120dB SPL low frequency noise (3-octave band centered at 1500Hz) and found that neural activity in the vestibular nerve was reduced, as assessed by the vestibular short latency evoked potential (VsEP). Noise exposed animals also exhibited reduced numbers of immunostained afferents with calyx endings, especially calyx-only afferents that terminate on hair cells located in the striolar region of the sacculus (Stewart et al. 2018). More recent experiments show that noise, depending on its intensity, can cause either temporary or permanent threshold shifts of VsEP responses to jerk stimuli. Permanent noise induced VsEP threshold shifts could reflect loss of calyces and/or concomitant loss of ribbon synapses within calyces. This loss might be permanent or there could be recovery associated with reconnection of calyces or recovery of synapses. We hypothesize that noise disrupts peripheral vestibular synapses and/or synaptic transmission, transiently or permanently and causes functional vestibular loss. Determining the basis for synaptic/signal transmission failure in the vestibular periphery and the parameters that characterize damaging noise is a critical first step toward development of future preventative measures. Specific Aim 1 will determine the parameters of noise that causes temporary versus permanent changes to the VsEP and to peripheral vestibular nerve terminals and their synapses in the saccular and utricular maculae. Specific Aim 2 will extend the analysis of Aim 1 to examine the semicircular canal cristae and compare noise-induced changes in the cristae with those observed in the otolith organs. Specific Aim 3 will correlate changes in VsEP responses and noise induced synaptic pathology with behavioral assays: a beam crossing task, an otolith dependent behavior (macular ocular reflex, MOR), and a semicircular canal dependent behavior (vestibuloocular reflex, VOR).",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2808,414,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01MD014958-03,Disparities in utilization and delivery outcomes for women with perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD): groundwork for state policymaking,"This study directly responds to NIMHD Program Announcement for Health Services Research on Minority Health and Health Disparities (PAR-20-310). Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), which include depression and/or anxiety in the year before and/or after delivery, are common complications of pregnancy, affecting up to one in four women, with costs over $15 billion per year in the US. PMAD can negatively affect mothers, babies, and families beyond the perinatal period, and have lasting clinical and economic effects. PMAD treatment can improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes, yet mental health services are rarely used. No comprehensive data source documents the: 1) magnitude, 2) predictors, and 3) variation in disparities by race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography in healthcare utilization or obstetric delivery outcomes among women with PMAD. Almost no evidence documents the impact of community characteristics on these outcomes. There is no national plan for how best to address PMAD, overall, or within high-risk subgroups. Using data from publicly (Medicaid) and privately (Optum) insured women with PMAD, state survey data, input from a panel of perinatal mental health services and policy experts, and interviews with state maternal and infant health (MIH) and MH policy makers, we will: 1) identify patient-level clinical characteristics associated with MH and overall perinatal utilization and delivery-related outcomes among women with diagnosed PMAD, and establish accurate national and state-level estimates of disparities in care patterns and outcomes, including MH utilization, overall utilization, and delivery-outcomes; 2) determine contributions of community-level characteristics to perinatal utilization and delivery outcomes among women with PMAD using data from Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), Area Health Resource File (AHRF), and National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS); and 3) collaborate with an expert panel to develop an evidence-based policymaking guide for PMAD, which we will use to interview state maternal and infant health and mental health policy officials. Using Aim 1-2 findings and expert panel input, we will develop an EBP guide for PMAD. This guide will provide structure for interviews with state maternal and infant health and mental health policy officials from states with high and low relative performance on PMAD treatment and outcomes to help interpret quantitative findings, tailor recommendations, and assist in future PMAD policymaking initiatives. Given the dearth of research on disparities in addressing PMAD and associated utilization and delivery outcomes, and the high, inter-generational costs for mother and baby of ineffectively managed PMAD, this innovative, large-scale investigation will provide evidence for future policymaking and clinical interventions.

The parent grant tests methods to assist high risk individuals in attaining both the weight management and diet quality goals for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Existing recruitment plans for this study mainly rely on clinic-based recruitment and research registries, strategies which have yielded largely well-educated, white study populations in our prior work. Here, we propose methods to optimize recruitment and retention using video education tools to de-mystify the research study, and personal technology assistants to address digital literacy barriers. In the first aim, three short videos will be made for the study website to introduce study staff, show how to reach the study site, explain the study objectives, show visit procedures and address privacy and security concerns. The goal is to build trust and de-mystify the clinical/medical aspects of the trial. Evaluations will include assessing the numbers of individuals contacted from the website versus other sources, comparisons with previous recruitment efforts of high-risk individuals (numbers over time, demographics), website feature usage, and interviews with study staff and enrolled participants to collect opinions regarding the utility of the website. In the second aim, we will evaluate the utility of a Personal Technology Assistant to spur both recruitment and retention of study participants. Limited technology proficiency is well documented to reduce participation in studies that require web-based tasks. This is especially true for older individuals and individuals with who are not yet adept at using the web. Personal Technology Assistants, who are trained to provide digital health literacy support in a culturally sensitive manner, will assist participants with the MyGI mobile app on request, at either the study site and/or at community sites. Evaluations will include quantitative data such as numbers of study participants requesting this assistance as well as interviews of both study participants and study staff. Mixed methods analysis of the quantitative and qualitative assessment data will yield robust information on the utility of the new strategies. If effective, use of both strategies will be continued throughout the study recruitment period. The ongoing maintenance costs will be undertaken by the parent study since the major costs involved with implementation of these aims is in the development of the strategies. The long-term goal of these efforts is to facilitate equitable recruitment and retention of participants in the parent study and to provide in-depth data on the utility of the methodologies that leads to their implementation in other trials.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2804,417,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R35GM149197-01,Signaling activation and constraints in maintaining immune homeostasis,"The innate immune system detects pathogen-derived molecules to prevent infections via specialized immune receptors. The immune receptors include cell surface-resident pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mammals and receptor kinases (RKs) in plants, and intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in plants and mammals. Plant PRRs detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), whereas NLRs recognize pathogen-specific effectors, culminating in a unified immune system. How the signaling networks underlying PRR- and NLR-mediated immunity are interconnected remains largely unknown. In addition, defects or over-activation of immune receptors could lead to cell death or autoimmunity. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that enable or constrain PRR and NLR activation for maintaining immune homeostasis is particularly important. The PI’s laboratory has developed a series of sensitive and high-throughput genetic screens to dissect the complex activation and signaling mechanisms in plant immunity, and revealed the importance of malectin-like RKs (MLRs) as a molecular module at the plasma membrane linking PRR and NLR immune receptors. PI’s long-term goal is to elucidate the signaling networks regulating innate immune responses using Arabidopsis as a model system and expand the knowledge of how hosts fend off infections without causing autoimmune disorders. The proposed research rooted in PI’s previous discoveries and preliminary studies will support a series of projects that address several critical knowledge gaps in two interrelated research areas. First, the research will elucidate how the PRR- and NLR-mediated signaling pathways converge into an interconnected and balanced immune response. Specifically, the projects will mechanistically address how a PRR-activated MAP kinase cascade regulates NLR-mediated immune homeostasis through MLRs perceiving different peptide ligands. Second, the research will decipher the immune gene orchestration through the combinatorial action of the layered transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational regulations at the single-cell level. The projects will focus on how intertwined posttranslational modifications, including ADP-ribosylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, regulate immune-specific gene transcription, stability, and translation. The proposed interdisciplinary research will provide ample training opportunities for diverse undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2530,326,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R34MH130207-02,Strengthening community responses to economic vulnerability and HIV inequities,"In the United States, transgender women of color (`trans women of color') experience cyclical, interlocking systems of structural and institutional oppression rooted in racism and transphobia, which fuel economic vulnerability. Together, cycles of intersecting racism, transphobia, and economic vulnerability create conditions that give rise to extreme HIV inequities among trans women of color. Microeconomic interventions – designed to improve financial standing by increasing income generation and access to financial resources through entrepreneurship, cash transfers, and training — have the potential to address structural factors underlying HIV risk. Over the past few years, several trans-led organizations, including the Trans Sistas of Color Project, have integrated microeconomic strategies, specifically emergency assistance (i.e., unconditional cash grants) into their programming. Building on our formative work in Detroit, this project seeks to adapt and examine the acceptability and feasibility of an enhanced microeconomic intervention designed to address HIV prevention and care continua outcomes. The enhanced microeconomic intervention builds on our community partner's existing microeconomic interventions, which includes: (1) an emergency assistance; and (2) peer and legal support to obtain legal gender affirmation (i.e., legal name and gender markers on identification documents). The existing intervention will be enhanced to include (1) weekly educational sessions on economic empowerment (i.e., job acquisition, income generation through micro-business, and financial literacy) and HIV prevention and care; (2) employment-focused mentoring; (3) weekly social media posts of job openings in Detroit; and (4) an unconditional grant ($1,200) for use towards acquiring self-led or formal employment. Our community advisory board composed of trans women of color will provide ongoing consultation. The proposed research plan is directly in line with the prioritization of sexual and gender minority communities for health disparities research and the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative, as well as NIH priority areas for reducing HIV incidence.

5R01AT011341-03,Mechanisms of cannabidiol in persons with MS: the role of sleep and pain phenotype,"Chronic pain affects 35-40% of people with chronic neurological conditions, including persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) - an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system affecting approximately 1 million Americans. Unfortunately, the analgesic effects of conventional treatments for pain in neurological conditions is limited. Cannabidiol (CBD, derived from cannabis sativa) is a safe, promising complimentary therapy that is frequently used in combination with Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to treat pain in persons with MS (PwMS). However, the distinct analgesic mechanisms of CBD - relative to better-studied cannabinoid formulations such as THC or THC/CBD combinations (which carry abuse potential) - are not well understood, galvanizing the need for mechanistic research focused on CBD monotherapy. Preliminary data from a nationwide study of PwMS conducted by the investigators suggest that CBD could independently exert analgesic effects through improved sleep, particularly among PwMS with nociplastic (centralized) pain. Investigations that now build upon these early findings could provide novel insight into mechanisms by which CBD induces analgesic effects, and identify pain phenotypes that are most likely to be responsive to CBD for chronic pain. This innovative, mechanistic study proposes to apply novel polysomnographic sleep stage analyses that extend beyond conventional polysomnography (PSG) measures, and new features of sleep macrostructure derived from in-home actigraphy, to assess aspects of sleep that could play key mechanistic roles in the analgesic effects of CBD. Our overarching goal is to apply these novel sleep assessment methods, coupled with validated pain phenotyping techniques, to uncover unique mechanistic associations between CBD, sleep, and analgesia in PwMS, compared to THC monotherapy, THC/CBD combination therapy, or placebo. Persons with MS who experience chronic pain will undergo pain phenotyping with validated survey measures of nociplastic and neuropathic pain, and randomized to CBD (Epidiolex®), THC (dronabinol), THC/CBD combination, or placebo for 12 weeks. In-lab PSG and 14-day wrist-worn actigraphy will be collected at baseline and 12 weeks’ post-treatment. Changes in sleep microstructure (Aim 1; including sleep stage bout length, sleep stage transition probability, and entropy) and macrostructure (Aim 2; including sleep regularity, rhythmicity, timing and duration) will be compared between cannabinoid and placebo groups, and pain phenotype will be assessed as a predictor of CBD-related changes in sleep. Aim 3 will assess the measures of sleep microstructure and macrostructure as mediators of analgesic response to CBD. Data generated from this study will to inform CBD research, across a spectrum of neurological and other chronic conditions, that can be applied to the development of precision-medicine approaches for chronic pain.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2912,410,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5F31DA056192-02,GPCR activation-based in vitro luminescent assays for high-throughput drug screening and extracted GPCR characterization,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) are transmembrane signaling proteins found abundantly throughout the body. GPCRs are responsible for regulating many physiological processes including pain modulation and drug addiction. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is one of the most significant GPCRs since it is implicated in the opioid epidemic as the primary target for therapeutic analgesics. High-throughput screening (HTS) methods for detecting GPCR activity are highly desirable for discovering alternative, nonaddictive agonists. All the existing screening platforms are based on maintaining live-cell cultures due to the lack of methods for characterizing GPCR activity in-solution. Here I propose the design of the first in-solution HTS bioluminescent assay for detecting GPCR activity which will greatly streamline the process of GPCR ligand screening. The new assay features conformation specific binders, including nanobodies (Nb) and peptidomimetics, which will bind to the activated conformation of the GPCR, both in-solution and in live-cell cultures. Components of a split bioluminescent enzyme, Nanoluciferase (split NanoLuc), will be attached to the GPCR and the conformation specific binder. When the agonist-dependent interaction occurs, the NanoLuc will reconstitute and produce a quantifiable bioluminescent signal in the presence of furimazine. I have already validated the feasibility of this in-solution bioluminescent assay using beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and its conformation-specific binders, a G-protein mimic Nanobody and a novel peptidomimetic. The assay will be applied for screening MOR agonists and antagonists using its conformation-specific nanobody binders, Nb39 and Nb44. Additionally, I propose to adapt the in-solution bioluminescent assay for broader applications using G-protein peptidomimetics. The platform will be used to screen agonists and antagonists for a wide variety of GPCRs, extending the screening capabilities to include additional GPCRs implicated in drug abuse. Lastly, this assay will provide a new approach to validate the structural integrity of GPCRs isolated from membranes using nanodiscs. Overall, the screening assay proposed here could have far-reaching therapeutic impacts resulting from the discovery of non-addictive pain medications or agonists to suppress opioid-induced addiction.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2364,321,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5T32HL125242-09,Training Program in Translational Cardiovascular Research and Entrepreneurship,"This renewal proposal seeks continued funding for the Training program in Translational Cardiovascular Research and Entrepreneurship (CVRE) at the University of Michigan.

5R01EB032328-02,Quantifying and Understanding Glaucoma Eye Drop Medication Instillation and Adherence,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Despite the availability of effective treatments, glaucoma remains the leading cause of irreversible blindness among African American adults and the second leading cause of irreversible blindness in the United States. Non-adherence to daily prescribed eye drop medications – the treatment for 89% of glaucoma patients - is a key modifiable driver of vision loss in glaucoma. In current practice, patients are diagnosed with glaucoma and simply given a prescription, with only 1 in 8 prescribing physicians teaching patients how to use eye drops. 40% of glaucoma patients do not take their daily eye drop medication according to the prescribed schedule. 20% of glaucoma patients do not succeed in getting drops into their eyes. Glaucoma primarily affects older adults who may have aging-related sensorimotor deficits that impair successful medication instillation. Our long term goal is to develop a comprehensive system to monitor medication use, quantify whether administered drops are successfully delivered, communicate usage data to the patient’s health care team, and coach each patient on how to use their eye drop medications. Our central hypothesis is that by identifying the biomechanical and sensorimotor factors associated with eye drop instillation success – whether a drop gets in the eye – we can develop more effective, personalized intervention strategies to improve medication adherence and increase instillation success. Our overall objectives are to: 1) use motion sensors that measure the biomechanical movement of instilling eye drops, together with tests of sensorimotor abilities, to identify factors that result in successful eye drop instillation success among older adults; and 2) use input from older participants to design a comprehensive, simple, and user-friendly Eye Drop Adherence Monitoring System (EAMS). The EAMS will consist of a low-power, portable, on-bottle sensor and a cellular-linked communication base station to identify remotely when an eye drop was dispensed and record the probability of successful instillation. The EAMS will also integrate a personalized text message program tailored to individual adherence levels. Following development, we will test the EAMS to assess the agreement between EAMS classification of an eye drop use event and eye drop instillation success and an eye drop use diary and video- recorded eye drop instillation. We will assess the acceptability of the system among a sample of glaucoma patients through qualitative interviews. Impact: Our interdisciplinary team will gain and share new knowledge about the biomechanics of eye drop instillation and the impact of the sensorimotor deficits of aging on eye drop medication use. This knowledge will inform the development of a scalable Eye Drop Adherence Monitoring System (EAMS) that can be used clinically to improve the effectiveness of glaucoma care in preventing vision loss. This tool will be able to assess adherence to eye drop medications in both the clinical and research settings. A deeper understanding will inform patient-centered approaches to self-management support and aid in closing outcomes disparities in glaucoma – and every other condition needing eye drop medications.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3233,483,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01AI165381-02,Roles of Macropinocytosis in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T Cells,"Title: Roles of Macropinocytosis in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T Cells Project Summary: Host cell entry is the first step in the replication cycle of HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS. Although receptor binding of viral Env glycoprotein and subsequent virus-cell fusion during the virus entry process have been described in detail, subcellular locations of these events remain to be determined. In particular, despite the importance of CD4+ T lymphocytes as a natural host cell type for HIV-1, the contribution of virion endocytosis to HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells remains poorly understood. Previous studies of HIV-1 entry into T cells have largely focused on clathrin-mediated endocytosis and cell surface fusion. However, our team recently discovered that primary CD4+ T cells engage in robust macropinocytosis, a large-scale, clathrin-independent form of endocytosis. Importantly, our preliminary data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of macropinocytosis blocks both internalization of HIV-1 particles and productive infection in primary human CD4+ T cells. In contrast, the same treatment does not affect HIV infection of a commonly used CD4+ T cell line. These results suggest that the macropinocytic entry is a hitherto overlooked mode of HIV-1 entry that contributes to infection of primary human CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, our preliminary study also showed that inhibition of macropinocytosis after completion of virus internalization also blocks expression of virus-encoded genes, suggesting that macropinocytosis has another later role in productive HIV infection, which is separable from virus internalization. In the current application, we propose to determine the roles of macropinocytosis in productive infection of primary CD4+ T cells. Our long-term goal is to fully describe cellular mechanisms that promote HIV-1 infection and to use the obtained knowledge for developing antiviral strategies. Our central hypothesis in this application is that macropinocytosis in primary human CD4+ T cells contributes to productive infection as a major HIV-1 entry pathway and as a cellular function necessary for maintaining a permissive environment for the virus. To test this hypothesis, we plan to determine: 1) the extent to which macropinocytic internalization contributes to productive HIV entry into primary human CD4+ T cells; 2) the roles played by Env-receptor interactions in promoting HIV-1 macropinocytosis; 3) the influence of macropinosome environment on HIV-1 entry; and 4) the nature of post-internalization macropinocytosis function that promotes productive infection. The outcomes of the experiments outlined in this proposal will likely fill the knowledge gap in our understanding of HIV-1 entry, a fundamental aspect of the HIV-1 replication cycle, and help us develop or improve antiviral strategies that target virus entry and establishment of productive infection in CD4+ T cells.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2922,427,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5F32GM140694-03,Sulfide metabolism at the host microbiome interface,"Project Summary Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a redox-active signaling molecule that modulates electron transport and energy metabolism, and by largely unknown mechanisms, mediates neuro- and cardioprotection, vasodilation, the hypoxic response, protein translation, epigenetics, aging, and both patho- and physiological responses in colon. As H2S is also a respiratory poison at high doses, cells actively oxidize it to produce persulfides, sulfite, thiosulfate, (collectively referred to as reactive sulfur species), and sulfate. Oxidative modification of protein cysteine thiols to persulfides is postulated to be a primary mechanism by which H2S signals. The potential involvement of other reactive sulfur species in signaling is however, unknown. Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that H2S impacts cellular redox metabolism via its dual effects on mitochondrial energetics, i.e. increasing electron flux at low, and inhibiting it at high concentrations. The highest exposure to exogenous H2S occurs in colon (0.2–2.4 mM) and is derived from gut resident microbiota, which synthesize sulfide. Preliminary data in our laboratory reveal that colonic epithelial cells quantitatively oxidize exogenous H2S to thiosulfate, and that the localization and expression levels of sulfide oxidation enzymes in murine colonocytes are strongly influenced by the presence or absence of sulfate reducing bacteria in the gut. I hypothesize that the dynamic interplay between host and microbial sulfur metabolites influences host metabolism and impacts longevity. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, which has the full complement of orthologous genes involved in H2S biogenesis and oxidation found in humans and is readily amenable to genetic and dietary manipulation and to life-span analyses, I will test my hypothesis by addressing the following two aims. (i) I will characterize how alterations in H2S levels and reactive sulfur species impact organismal redox and histone modifications that are linked to longevity and stress response in C. elegans. H2S levels and its oxidative byproducts will be modulated by exogenous H2S, RNA interference knockdowns of host sulfide oxidation enzymes, and by diet, using Escherichia coli with deletions in specific genes involved in sulfur metabolism. I will assess how exogenous versus dietary H2S modulation affects organismal redox using the genetically encoded reduction-oxidation sensitive GRX1-roGFP2 sensor and track changes in histone methylation and acetylation status with reported links to redox, H2S availability, diet, and aging. (ii) I will investigate how differences in exogenous H2S exposure from air versus gut microbes affects the expression and localization of host sulfide oxidation enzymes, the abundance and type of reactive sulfur species, and their effect on lifespan. I will complement these studies with metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses to identify pathways that are impacted by H2S exposure. The successful completion of these studies will be foundational to our understanding of the interplay of sulfur metabolism at the host-microbe interface.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3128,448,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01NS122751-03,Nonneuronal Mechanisms of Polyglutamine Neurodegeneration,"Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is one of at least nine diseases caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode abnormally long polyglutamine tracts in the disease proteins. Despite advances in disease understanding, much remains unknown about how the CAG expansion in the SCA3 disease gene, ATXN3, causes brain dysfunction and cell death. We recently discovered selective oligodendrocyte vulnerability across SCA3 mouse disease brain regions and identified early and robust changes that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. Our long-term objective is to understand pathogenic mechanisms in SCA3 and related polyglutamine diseases so that therapies targeting the most promising molecular and cellular targets can be developed for these fatal and currently untreatable disorders. Toward that objective, the team of investigators will leverage their diverse research expertise and a wide range of model systems including primary cell cultures, mouse models, and human disease tissue. Building on recent discoveries in mouse models and human disease tissue, we will investigate nonneuronal contributions to disease pathogenesis, with an emphasis on cells of the oligodendroglial lineage. In Aim 1, we will determine how widespread oligodendrocyte dysfunction is in SCA3 disease. In Aim 2, we will generate novel conditional SCA3 mouse models to establish if the mutant protein elicits cell-autonomous oligodendrocyte dysfunction and define oligodendrocyte dysfunction contributions to disease pathogenesis.

5R37CA262209-02,Defining epigenetic signaling to reshape pancreatic tumor microenvironment,"The 5-year survival of pancreatic cancer patients remains at 10% primarily due to the tumor resistance to standard chemo and immunotherapies. The profound immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment contributes to treatment resistance. Notably, 82% of the neoadjuvant-treated pancreatic cancers carry loss of function mutations for KMT2D, a histone modification enzyme. Epigenetics is known to impact cancer cell behavior. However, how tumor cell-intrinsic epigenetic alterations modulate the pancreatic tumor microenvironment remains elusive. The long-term goal is to develop new treatments to convert pancreatic cancer to an immunologically hot tumor and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy and patient survival. The overall objectives in this application are to 1) determine the impact of KMT2D signaling on the tumor microenvironment and 2) characterize the mechanisms by which KMT2D regulates activin A expression. The central hypothesis is that upregulation of activin A upon KMT2D loss in pancreatic cancer reprograms cancer- associated fibroblasts and immune cells to promote a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive microenvironment. The rationale for this project is that the knowledge of the mechanisms by which KMT2D regulates the tumor microenvironment will pave the way for future preclinical and clinical development of new strategies to treat pancreatic cancer. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Elucidate the impact of KMT2D signaling on the immune composition in the tumor microenvironment; 2) Define the regulation of heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts by KMT2D signaling; and 3) Determine the molecular mechanisms of activin A regulation by KMT2D in pancreatic cancer. Under the first and second aims, we will use our established pancreatic cancer genetic mouse models with pancreas-specific inactivation of KMT2D to determine the impact of KMT2D signaling on the differentiation and activation of cancer- associated fibroblasts, macrophages, and T cells, and ligand-receptor interactions in the tumor microenvironment and the underlying mechanisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing technology, mass cytometry, and multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry will be used. For the third aim, we will characterize the interactions between KMT2D and co-factors and the mechanisms of KMT2D-mediated regulation of activin A transcription and enhancer activity using ChIP-seq, BruUV-seq, and functional luciferase reporter assays. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on a novel concept that epigenetic signaling from tumor cells remodels the tumor microenvironment and contributes to cancer progression and uses state-of-the-art animal models and approaches. The proposed research is significant because it will shed light on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by KMT2D in pancreatic cancer and the effect of KMT2D signaling on pancreatic tumor microenvironment, which will set the stage for future preclinical and clinical development of new tumor microenvironment-targeting treatment strategies.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3092,426,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HD084163-09,"The Development of Eating Behavior in Infancy: Associations with Behavior, Diet, and Growth to Age 6 years","PROJECT SUMMARY Eating behaviors are robustly associated with dietary quality and weight gain. Given the relevance of eating behaviors to health in children and adults, remarkably little is known regarding the development of these behaviors from infancy, and their continuity (or discontinuity) into childhood. Eating behaviors can be phenotyped in infancy through rigorous measurement of behavior following exposure to different stimuli under careful experimental control, though no studies prior to R01HD084163 have phenotyped multiple eating behaviors objectively in a single longitudinal infant cohort. Eating behavior may be modifiable between infancy and early childhood, potentially altering any associations with future dietary quality or weight gain. Interventions that promote adaptive maternal feeding practices have been effective in reducing obesity risk. Intervention effects might be further strengthened by tailoring to characteristics of the individual child. Identifying interactions of carefully phenotyped child eating behavior and maternal feeding practices in an observational cohort study is an important initial step towards future tailored intervention development. The proposed work will examine for the first time the continuity (or discontinuity) of extensively phenotyped eating behaviors in infancy, based on novel objective measures and maternal report, to age 5 years. The work will, for the first time, test whether maternal feeding practices and infant eating behaviors interact to predict child eating behaviors at age 5 years, as well as dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years. The ABC Baby study (R01HD084163, 7/1/15-06/30/20) and its ancillary funded studies used novel behavioral protocols to phenotype eating behavior and maternal feeding practices longitudinally at ages 2 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months in a cohort of 286 infants. The current application proposes to follow up with 200 of these children at ages 5 and 6 years to address the following aims: Aim 1: To test the cross-lagged associations between child eating behaviors and maternal feeding practices across infancy and age 5 years. We hypothesize that child eating behaviors in infancy predict child eating behaviors at age 5 years, maternal feeding practices in infancy predict maternal feeding practices at age 5 years, child eating behaviors in infancy predict maternal feeding practices at 5 years, and maternal feeding practices in infancy predict child eating behaviors at 5 years. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that eating behaviors measured in infancy have direct and indirect (through eating behaviors at age 5 years) associations with dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years. Aim 3: To test the hypotheses that maternal feeding practices in infancy moderate associations of infant eating behaviors with eating behaviors at 5 years, and that maternal feeding practices at 5 years moderate associations of eating behaviors in infancy with dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years, and moderate associations of eating behaviors at age 5 years with dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3103,468,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL161386-03,Role of Adiposomes in Diabetes-Associated Endothelial Dysfunction and Restorative Effects of Exercise and Metabolic Surgery,"The development of type II diabetes (T2D) is strongly associated with obesity, and both are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Vascular dysfunction is an early event in developing cardiovascular disease in obese diabetic (OB-T2D) patients. Therefore, we set our long-term goal to define molecular mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and corrective strategies that target these mechanisms, such as physical activity and weight loss. We recently discovered that human adipose tissues release extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) that are efficiently captured by endothelial cells. Adiposomes are known to carry bioactive cargos such as proteins and micro RNAs; however, their lipid content has not been studied, neither their ability to transfer their lipid cargo to endothelial cells. In the current application, we propose investigating the role of adiposomes in communicating the unhealthy milieu, mainly dysregulated lipids, to endothelial cells in OB-T2D subjects. On top of these lipid species that we propose to be carried by adiposomes are glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs originate from ceramide glycosylation, a chemical process that is upregulated in the presence of inflammation and high glucose levels. Our preliminary findings showed that in endothelial cells, GSL-rich adiposomes disturb plasma membrane structure and subsequently induces endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, we found preconditioning endothelial cells with high shear stress (which is an exercise mimetic) protected endothelial cells from the detrimental effects caused by adiposomes. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that adipose tissues in OB-T2D patients release GSL-loaded adiposomes that induce vascular endothelial dysfunction. We propose that exercise and weight loss interventions (bariatric surgery) will restore adipose tissue homeostasis, reduce GSL-loaded adiposomes, and subsequently alleviate vascular risk in OB-T2D patients. We will test our hypotheses by pursuing the following Aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of GSL-rich adiposomes in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in OB- T2D adults; Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of exercise training in reducing adiposome-mediated effects on vascular function; and Aim 3: Examine changes in adiposome/caveolae axis following metabolic surgery and their association with vascular function. This study will improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological underpinning of adiposome production, packaging, and role in inducing ED under conditions of obesity and T2D. It will also identify adiposomes and the proposed mechanisms of their interaction with endothelial cells as novel therapeutic targets for improving vascular function in OB-T2D individuals. Once these pathways are elucidated, strategies for targeting them can be advanced, leading to an improved therapeutic management of T2D-related cardiovascular disease.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2898,398,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL152515-04,Amplification Mechanisms of Lung Endothelial Inflammation During Acute Lung Injury,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Lung failure from endotoxemia and sepsis induces widespread and often rapid lung vascular endothelial injury due to unfettered influx of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. This maladaptive inflammatory response outpaces the reparative capacity of lungs, resulting in profound inflammatory lung injury and hypoxemia. This proposal focuses on fundamental amplification mechanisms underlying the maladaptive inflammatory activation of the lung endothelium. Our central hypothesis is that the inflammatory response to threat signals such as the initial breaching of the endothelial plasma membrane by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rapid release of mitochondrial DNA by the injured mitochondria into the cytosol massively and acutely amplifies the inflammatory response and thus serves as essential feed-forward mechanisms for progression of acute lung injury (ALI). In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which the recently identified perforin Gasdermin D mediates endothelial plasma membrane pore formation and the mechanisms of activation of the K+ efflux ion channel TWIK2 that we have recently identified. We will address the role of amplifying K+ efflux on the severity and rapidity of endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and fulminant lung injury. In Aim 2, we will define another crucial amplification mechanism, the potentially important role of Gasdermin D-mediated mitochondrial (mt) membrane pore formation and the release of mtDNA, which may also catastrophically amplifiy lung injury via activation of Type I interferon signaling. These mechanistically driven studies will utilize genetic mouse models (endothelial specific knockout models in our labs) as well as comprehensive imaging, electrophysiological and physiological approaches and thus provide the framework for identifying novel endothelial amplification inflammatory mechanisms that induce lung vascular injury and ALI. We will elucidate how these pathways can be targeted to reduce tissue damage and improve survival.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2059,287,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01MD014839-04,Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE),"This application proposes to examine a novel social epigenetic mechanism for racial inequality in lung cancer: Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE). We will examine the relationships between exposure to violence, inflammatory responses, smoking and epigenetic changes in protein arginine methyl transferases (PRMT6) that increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that smoking induces increased expression of PRMT6 in the lung epithelium. We also showed that overexpression of PRMT6 triggers spontaneous lung tumors in mice. Interestingly, we found that PRMT6 is upregulated among black men compared with white men in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thus we argue that the increased overexpression of PRMT6 among black men may explain a higher rate of lung cancer among black men compared with white men. While smoking is a key contributing factor for lung cancer, the frequency and amount of cigarette smoking are not necessarily higher for blacks, which suggests that other factors are responsible for racial disparity in lung cancer. Disproportionate social stress in black communities may be responsible for a higher rate of lung cancer among blacks. In particular, individuals living in excessive neighborhood violence are exposed to chronic stress, which may intensify the epigenetic changes for lung cancer. We hypothesize that exposure to neighborhood violence is social stress that increases biophysical inflammatory responses, which exacerbate the path between smoking, PRMT6 overexpression, and lung cancer. To examine the proposed social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity, first, we will test the independent effect of smoking and exposure to neighborhood violence, and the interaction of the two risks on PRMT6 expression using retrospective tissue samples from black and white lung cancer cases (Aim 2). Second, we will test the effect of exposure to violence on an inflammatory response (hair cortisol) and lung cancer screening outcomes by conducting a prospective survey and data collection with high-risk black men (Aim 3). Finally, we will build a multilevel, context-specific lung cancer risk profiles (Aim 1) that take into account not only individual behavioral risk (smoking), but neighborhood stress (exposure to violence), physiological inflammatory responses (increased cortisol), and molecular changes (PRMT6 overexpression). To develop such risk profiles, we utilize a composite population data approach to establish accurate counts of all individuals within census tracts with sociodemographic, behavioral, and neighborhood risk profiles. The strength of RECODE is its innovative approach to unveil a social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity. RECODE has the potential to transform understanding multilevel risks of lung cancer and improve the national lung cancer screening guidelines to reflect the social conditions of racial minority communities.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3013,433,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DK102960-09,'Metabolically Activated' Macrophages in Obesity and Insulin Resistance,"Visceral obesity associates with insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, which are major risk factors for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Although the cellular hallmark of obesity is neutral lipid expansion in adipocytes, adipose tissue of obese mice and humans also accumulate macrophages and other leukocytes. It is well accepted that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) play a critical role in systemic insulin resistance, suggesting that inflammatory mediators produced by ATMs are important factors linking excess fat mass to insulin sensitivity, glucose intolerance, and increased atherosclerotic risk. Understanding the mechanistic basis of the pro-inflammatory ATM phenotype and ATM function is required to devise new strategies for attenuating inflammation in metabolic disease. Pro-inflammatory pathways in ATMs are commonly attributed to classical activation (exposure to bacteria, M1), establishing molecular links between innate immunity and metabolic dysfunction. Recent studies, including work from our lab, suggest that M1 activation fails to accurately represent the complex phenotype of ATMs in vivo. We have shown that ATMs in obese adipose tissue from humans and mice adopt a unique ‘metabolically activated’ (MMe) phenotype that is distinct from the M1 phenotype. Inhibiting MMe activation of macrophages in vivo, attenuates ATM inflammation and improved glucose tolerance in mice. Moreover, the abundance of MMe-like ATMs in visceral fat is positively correlated with insulin resistance in patients controlled for adiposity. These findings underscore the pathophysiological importance of MMe macrophages in mice and humans. Although MMe and M1 macrophages are both characterized by increased expression of NFkB-induced inflammatory cytokines (ie. Tnfa, Il1b, Il6), our preliminary studies demonstrate that the upstream signaling cascades driving NFkB activation are remarkably distinct. We provide evidence for a novel fatty acid-driven, ROS-dependent, tyrosine-kinase mediated, pro-inflammatory signaling cascade in MMe macrophages. Targeting this ‘metabolically activated NFkB’ (Me-NFkB) pathway at any point selectively attenuates inflammatory cytokine expression by MMe macrophages. Our work has positioned us to test the innovative hypothesis that this Me-NFkB pathway promotes ATM inflammation and insulin resistance during obesity but is dispensable for inflammation required for host defense during infection. Specifically, we plan to 1) Delineate the Me-NFkB pathway that drives inflammation in MMe macrophages, and 2) Determine if targeting the Me-NFkB pathway improves insulin sensitivity in mice. Overall, our proposed studies aim to demonstrate that macrophage inflammation in metabolic disease can be attenuated without blocking these same cytokines in bacterial infection, a conceptual milestone that may lead to an improved anti-inflammatory strategy in the clinic.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2936,400,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R24EY033598-03,Alleviation of ER stress as a translational strategy to curb ocular viral infections,"Infection-associated blindness caused by herpesviruses is a leading cause of vision loss in the United States. Frontline therapies include the use of nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir which inhibit the viral thymidine kinase to restrict viral DNA replication. However, emergence of drug resistance and lack of strong corneal bioavailability have made it an urgent priority to develop alternative therapeutics. We have recently discovered a new mechanism through which herpesviruses, exemplified by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), propagate in the corneal epithelium. We have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized host protein cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) is essential to HSV-1 replication. Our findings shift the current understanding that CREB3 is only a cellular homolog of HSV-1 VP16. We showed that it is an important pro-viral factor that can be exploited to generate novel therapeutics against HSV infections. We for the first time showed that its modulation via a chemical chaperone 4- phenylbutyrate sodium (Na-PBA), can alleviate, ER stress, reduce CREB3 expression and inhibit viral replication. PBA is currently approved to treat urea cycle disorder. Our translational results are supported by strong in vivo murine data that suggests antiviral efficacy and topical dosage safety of Na-PBA. Due to the high sodium burden associated with Na-PBA administration, its unpalatability, and inability to penetrate sufficiently through corneal epithelium upon topical administration, we have developed various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations to overcome limitations associated with oral and topical delivery of Na-PBA. The purpose of this R24 application is to generate preclinical data in two animal models that support an IND application for repurposing PBA to treat ocular HSV infection. This will be achieved via 3 well thought, exhaustive specific aims. In the first aim, we will evaluate dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, and safety of orally and topically delivered Na-PBA solution and various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations. Furthermore, we will also determine oral and topical, and oral antiviral efficacy of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA nanoformulations in murine models of ocular HSV-1 infection. The second aim will use the most effective oral and topical formulation(s) and test their safety, PK, and efficacy in guinea pig and rabbit models of primary and reactivated ocular HSV-1 infection. Finally aim 3, we will investigate the potential of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA formulations to synergize with existing antiviral therapies to determine their potential as an add-on modality to the existing treatment. The latter is likely and significant since PBA is a rare drug that works via alleviating ER stress and aiding the host cell’s response to viral infection, and thereby reducing the chance for emergence of viral resistance. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team including scientists, clinicians, drug development and translation experts who can help us navigate through requisite FDA guidelines. PBA has the potential to become a safe and efficacious alternative to existing ocular antivirals very quickly.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3211,467,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01AI127411-07,Host's and microbiota's contribution to sexual dimorphism of autoimmunity,"Many of major autoimmune diseases are sexually dimorphic. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren’s syndrome, and some forms of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) are primarily occurring in females. It has been attributed to multiple factors including expression of the genes encoded by sex chromosomes, hormonal regulation of gene expression, and lately to unexpected regulation by commensal microbiota. Thus, understanding of sexual dimorphism of diseases requires that the problem be approached by a combination of different strategies. In this proposal, we take advantage of our abilities to perform state of the art experiments using genetically modified and gnotobiotic animals with original and constantly developing computational methods. Our preliminary data demonstrates the efficiency of such an integrative approach to the problem. We have suggested a ‘dual signal’ model of autoimmunity involving regulation by microbes and sex hormones. Accordingly, hormonal and microbial influences do not have to be simultaneous: they may be important at different stages of development or disease progression. We are focusing on T cell-intrinsic and T- cell-extrinsic effects of Androgen Receptor (AR) and the mechanisms of microbiota’s effect on T1D development. Given the complexity of the problem, we plan to pursue several carefully selected goals that will continue to lay foundation for the future expansion of research in this important area. Specific Aim 1. Determine the input of T cell-intrinsic and T cell-extrinsic mechanisms in the sexual dimorphism of T1D. 1.1. Determine whether all cells involved in AR-mediated protection from T1D are of bone marrow origin; 1.2. Define the role of myeloid cells in male protection from T1D; 1.3. Test the contribution of myeloid cells in T cell transfer experiments; 1.4. Test a role that transcription factor AIRE plays in sexual dimorphism of T1D. Specific Aim 2. Investigate the influence of AR signaling on T cell selection and function 2.1. Determine the influence of AR on the TCR repertoires; 2.2. Determine how the properties of the TCR affect the influence of AR on repertoire selection; 2.3. Study the role of AR in regulation of interferon gamma (IFNg) related to autoimmunity; 2.4. Study the role of AR in regulation of the IFNg locus; Specific Aim 3. Determine where and when the microbiota amplifies AR effects on T1D development. 3.1. Test T1D development in GF animals with conditional AR deficiencies; 3.2. Determine whether microbes contribute to changes in immune cells properties during their development; 3.3.

5R01AI038897-29,Surface Proteins of Gram-Positive Bacteria,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community- and hospital-acquired diseases. Infections with antibiotic-resistant MRSA strains are associated with increased mortality. To identify targets for anti-MRSA therapy, this proposal analyzes the trafficking of surface proteins, which is essential for S. aureus colonization and invasive disease. Surface proteins are anchored to the cell wall, a process that requires specific signals and targeting mechanisms. Sortase A recognizes the LPXTG motif in C-terminal sorting signals, which are cut and covalently linked to peptidoglycan. Two types of surface protein precursors are distinguished. Precursors with canonical signal peptides are deposited in the envelope at the cell poles. Precursors with YSIRKxxxGxxS motif signal peptides traffic to the cross-wall. Confined by septal membranes during cell division, the cross-wall separates newly divided cells. It represents the site of de novo peptidoglycan synthesis and is split for completion of the cell cycle. Here we report that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is synthesized at septal membranes and required for septal secretion of YSIRKxxxGxxS precursors. During secretion, the YSIRKx peptide is removed from the precursor. We screened temperature-sensitive mutants for defects in YSIRKxxxGxxS precursor secretion and identified variants with mutations in secA, secG and pepV. secA mutants are defective for the transport of all precursors, polar and septal secretion. secG and pepV mutants exhibit defects in septal secretion. SecA co-purifies with YSIRKxxxGxxS precursors and with PepV. We will test the hypothesis that lipid products of LTA synthesis are critical for the activation of PepV at septal membranes. Although YSIRKxxxGxxS precursors associate with SecA, we predict that precursor complexes cannot activate SecYEG translocons unless the YSIRKx peptide is removed. Upon completion of the cross-wall, LtaS, the catalyst of LTA synthesis, is cut and released while the products of LTA synthesis are dispersed until the next cell division cycle. The proposal will analyze LtaS variants defective in LTA synthesis and LtaS cleavage and characterize the contributions of specific lipids and LtaS regulation for septal secretion. We will characterize YSIRKxxxGxxS precursors bound to SecA for their ability to activate translocons in the presence of specifc lipids and PepV and study precursor mutants for their ability to activate SecYEG translocons. Last, we will characterize the subcellular distribution of PepV, its association with septal lipids, ability to cleave YSIRKxxGxxS precursors and contribution to S. aureus colonization and pathogenesis.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2660,381,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R21CA276820-02,SQLE and Sterols Contribute to Racial Disparity in ER+ Breast Cancer Patient Survival,"The racial disparity in breast cancer survival rates has largely been attributed to late-stage diagnoses and increased incidence of triple negative breast cancer in African American (AA) compared to non-Hispanic White (white) women. However, the latest statistics indicate that more than 50% of tumors in AA women are estrogen receptor positive (ER+). ER+ tumors are considered less aggressive and are typically treated effectively with endocrine therapies that target ER activity (i.e. tamoxifen) or estrogen production (i.e. aromatase inhibitors). Despite a generally favorable prognosis for women with ER+ breast cancer, AA women still have a greater risk than white women of dying from ER+ disease. We have found that AA women in the Chicago area have a 4 to 5-fold greater risk of death from ER+ breast cancer than white women, even after controlling for stage at diagnosis, treatment, and other known prognostic factors. This finding implies that biologic mechanisms are activated in ER+ breast cancer from AA women, resulting in resistance to endocrine therapy and a greater risk of relapse and death. Our overarching goal is to identify biological and molecular mechanisms contributing to the racial survival disparity in ER+ breast cancer patients. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of SQLE (squalene epoxidase), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of sterols, cholesterol, and oxysterols, as a potential driver of poor outcome in AA women with ER+ tumors. We hypothesize that elevated SQLE in ER+ tumors of AA women leads to an accumulation of biologically active sterols that function to promote tumor cell proliferation and survival. Mechanistically, we expect these sterols to function by altering ER activity and reducing responsiveness to endocrine therapies. To investigate this, we propose 3 aims: 1) to define the mechanism by which SQLE is up-regulated in ER+ breast tumors in AA women; 2) to identify SQLE-regulated sterols that are associated with race in ER+ breast tumors, and 3) to assess the cellular function and therapeutic potential of SQLE in ER+ tumors of AA women. To accomplish these aims, we will utilize newly generated tumor collections and novel preclinical models from AA women, as well as an innovative method we developed to detect and analyze multiple sterol species. Overall, we expect to establish SQLE as a critical player in the racial disparity observed in survival of patients with ER+ breast cancer. Importantly, we expect to uncover two new mechanisms that may explain i) how SQLE contributes to early relapse and ii) why SQLE expression is elevated in ER+ tumors of AA women. Ultimately, this work has the potential to increase health equity by improving survival for AA women with ER+ breast cancer through the development of novel preventive and treatment strategies that target underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to disparate outcomes.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2913,457,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R35GM148412-02,Structural and Functional Studies of Cell-Adhesion Receptors,"Project Abstract Cellular communication is essential for the development of all multicellular organisms, and is a key phenomenon that is disrupted in many human diseases. Cell-surface receptors mediate cellular communication and are the targets for 50% of FDA-approved drugs, highlighting their disease relevance and druggability. However, many cell-surface receptors remain understudied and undrugged. The research proposed in this application is focused on two families of such receptors, adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptors (aGPCRs), and teneurins. The structures, mechanisms of action and disease relevance of these two receptor families remain largely unknown; as their large size and complex biochemical nature has made them difficult to study. Recent genetic studies revealed that aGPCRs and teneurins have essential roles in development of the nervous system, skeletal system, and heart. These receptors are linked to diseases including cancer, developmental disorders, and brain malformations, raising an urgent need for mechanistic studies on aGPCRs and teneurins. My research program aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these receptors are activated, and to develop new tools to modulate their activity against relevant diseases. The research proposed in this application involves an interdisciplinary approach, integrating structural studies of these receptors and their ligands, biochemical and biophysical assays, protein engineering approaches, and functional assays. This research will build on our previous successes using this approach, which has yielded many three-dimensional structures of aGPCRs and teneurins, has revealed crucial mechanistic concepts in the field, and has allowed a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of these receptors. A major revelation from our work is that the large extracellular regions of aGPCRs and teneurins are directly involved in regulating receptor function. Despite these advances, fundamental questions remain unanswered. The ultimate goals of this proposal are to reveal how signal transduction is mediated within the domains of these large receptors, what exactly activates them under physiological conditions, how their evolution from early organisms to higher eukaryotes have changed and diversified their critical functions, and finally how, at the molecular level, we can inhibit or activate these receptors using synthetic ligands. Our structural studies will be complemented with mutagenesis, signaling assays, the use of synthetic binders to understand how the different components of these receptors control receptor function, and physiological analyses performed by collaborators that will test the relevance of the structural and functional studies. We expect that this research will provide critical insights into the mechanistic details of aGPCR and teneurin function that will be highly informative for the development of future therapeutics; we will also produce potent and selective synthetic ligands which can serve as tools for the scientific community to study aGPCRs and teneurins.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3089,435,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R21NS126808-02,Elucidating the role of the contralesional corticoreticulospinal tract for lower limb function after stroke.,"Chronic walking impairments such as decreased walking speed, endurance, and independence are common after stroke and limit physical activity, quality of life, and community involvement. These walking impairments contribute to high healthcare costs and the development of secondary disabilities. Walking impairments tend to persist despite gait rehabilitation, partly because we lack a comprehensive understanding of which brain pathways contribute to lower limb and walking recovery after stroke. Emerging evidence suggests that ipsilaterally-descending motor pathways from the non-lesioned hemisphere to the stroke-affected limb, specifically the corticoreticulospinal tract, may be enhanced. However, the measurement tools used in prior work, when considered in isolation, provide limited insight into whether this pathway is functional enhanced and contributes to improved lower limb function. The primary objective of this proposal is to address this question with the long-term goal of improving gait rehabilitation after stroke by identifying recovery-related motor pathways that can be targeted. Our central hypothesis is that the corticoreticulospinal tract from the non-lesioned brain hemisphere to the more affected limb will be enhanced after stroke. The secondary objective of this proposal is to determine whether the strength of the corticoreticulospinal tract from the non-lesioned brain hemisphere influences lower limb motor control. To achieve the objectives of this proposal, two specific aims will be tested in individuals with chronic stroke with a range of impairment. In Aim 1, we will develop a multi-dimensional estimate of whether the corticoreticulospinal tract is enhanced after stroke by combining three measures used in prior research: functional magnetic resonance imaging (non-lesioned brain activation), diffusion tensor imaging (structural integrity), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (functional excitability). In Aim 2, the association between the strength of the corticoreticulospinal tract from the non-lesioned hemisphere and lower limb motor control will be assessed. This analysis will account for measures of stroke severity (lesion load and lower limb impairment). The proposed work would be the first to use a multifaceted approach to comprehensively and rigorously assess whether brain pathways from the non-lesioned hemisphere to the stroke-affected lower limb are enhanced after stroke. Results from this work will improve our understanding of the brain pathways that contribute to walking recovery after stroke, essential information for improving walking rehabilitation. The proposed work will also provide insight into how stroke impairment influences the mechanisms of recovery and the optimal rehabilitative strategy. Support for the central hypothesis will be a major breakthrough that supports the potential for neuromodulation applied to non-lesioned brain pathways pathways to lead to improvements in walking recovery after stroke. Improvements in walking rehabilitation that result from the proposed work could lead to substantial reductions in chronic walking impairment, disability, and societal cost of stroke.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3175,438,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL112626-11,Notch in Angiogenesis and Vascular Biology,"Elucidating the signaling pathways that control angiogenesis allows new therapies to be designed for treatment of diseases where blood vessels are contributors, including blindness, inflammation, and cancer. Notch1 signaling generally acts as a negative regulator of angiogenic sprouting. We hypothesize that Notch4, a Notch receptor primarily expressed in endothelium, has both overlapping roles with Notch1 and distinct endothelial functions. We demonstrated that Notch4 promotes angiogenesis and possibly inflammation of blood vessels and surrounding cells. By removing Notch4 expression in blood vessels of mice or blocking Notch4 using an inhibitor, we discovered that Notch4 promotes angiogenesis in the developing retina. Notch4 is expressed in blood vessels of many types of tumors and we demonstrated that blocking Notch4 inhibits tumor growth when Notch4 is in tumor vessels. We found that endothelial Notch4 appears to function to alter both vessels and adjacent stromal tissue. Analysis of Notch4-regulated genes led us to discover that specific cytokine signaling proteins are regulated by Notch4, and not Notch1, a possible mechanism for Notch4 broad influence on both vessels and surrounding tissue. In these studies, we will define the unique signaling mechanisms regulated by Notch4 to understand how Notch4 promotes developmental, inflammatory-driven, and tumor angiogenesis and evaluate anti-Notch4 treatment for therapeutic benefit. We will use a new technique called CUT&RUN to see which genes are directly activated by Notch4 or Notch1 and use a novel RiboFlag translational analysis to understand expression control by each Notch protein. We will determine if newly discovered Notch4-regulated proteins promote angiogenesis and inflammation in cultured endothelial cells and remove Notch4 expression from endothelial cells in mice to determine if this causes reduced blood vessel growth, reduces the response to inflammation and reduces tumor growth. We will separately remove Notch1 or Notch4 genes from endothelium or remove both genes and describe result of Notch loss on developmental and pathological angiogenesis, establishing unique and overlapping roles for these genes. A new Notch inhibitor allows us to investigate pre- clinical therapeutic potential for treatment of proliferative retinopathy, an inflammatory eye disease, and in tumors that have Notch4 in the endothelial cells. We will investigate the stromal changes in tumors caused by genetic or pharmacologic blockade of Notch4 using flow cytometry and focused single cell RNA sequencing. In all of these studies, we will determine if select cytokines are regulated by Notch4 in healthy and disease-associated blood vessels, with the goal of understanding the mechanisms by which Notch4 impacts inflammation of blood vessels and surrounding tissue or tumor. Our goals for this proposal will be to discover the unique ways that Notch4 works to build normal blood vessels and contributes to diseased vessels, and to evaluate therapeutic strategies to prevent blindness caused by excess angiogenesis, reduce vascular inflammation, and block tumors.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3136,454,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

Colonoscopy starting early in adulthood and repeated yearly or biennially is the only recommended surveillance strategy which translates into ~25-50 lifetime colonoscopies. This intensive colonoscopy surveillance is not ideal because: a) CRC risk varies widely by LS gene and age, b) colonoscopies are invasive, costly, and not readily accessible to all patients, and c) adherence is suboptimal. Personalized surveillance strategies in LS that integrate non-invasive tests with colon- oscopy would address limitations and barriers in current clinical practice but have not been previously studied. To address these gaps, this multi-center, prospective trial will examine performance of fecal immunochemical test (FIT) in LS patients undergoing colonoscopy surveillance. In addition to measuring FIT test characteristics (specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive predictive value), this study will examine LS patients' attitudes and acceptability of non-invasive tests (Aim 1). The proposal will evaluate personalized surveillance strategies in LS that integrate non-invasive tests and colonoscopy using simulation modeling (Aim 2). An important deliverable is the 1st well-annotated, prospective LS biobank in the US for future studies of promising biomarkers and clinical outcomes (Aim 3). This study is timely because of the unique opportunity to harmonize data with the UK “FIT for Lynch” study that began recruitment in 2023 in order to evaluate FIT performance in a large, international LS cohort.

5R01HL158634-03,Signaling To and From the Vascular/Endothelial Compartment and Progression of HCM Linked to Sarcomere Mutations,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common familial cardiovascular disorder viewed as a genetic disease of the sarcomere, since most mutations occur in genes that encode sarcomere/cytoskeletal proteins. Despite decades of basic and clinical research, there are critical gaps in our knowledge concerning how defective biophysical signals in the myocyte influence the function of other cellular compartments of the heart during the clinical course of this disorder. We have reported that early interventions aimed at normalizing myofilament properties only partially prevent HCM progression. Moreover, removal of the triggering mutation does not always reverse progression. In experiments proposed here, we test the overall hypothesis that critical, but treatable, maladaptive modifications in the vascular/endothelial compartment occur early and in parallel with changes in myofilament properties in the progression of HCM linked to thin filament mutations triggering different biophysical and biochemical signals. Preliminary data strongly support a role for and a need to investigate vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction that exacerbate symptomatic HCM. Novel data support our focus on HIPPO/YAP/TAZ signaling with emphasis on protective effects of sphingsine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) signaling, which is common to the endothelium (EC) and myocytes (CM). Our aims are as follows: Aim 1. Determine the decline in coronary function, changes in vascular remodeling and mechano- sensing in HCM linked to mutationsTnT-R92Q and Tm-E180G with different signaling in progression to HCM. Aim 2. Establish whether restoration of the endothelial HIPPO pathway is sufficient to impede HCM progression. Evidence provided here for a role of EC HIPPO/YAP/TAZ signaling in HCM progression demands an investigation of the consequences of its regulation, and whether therapeutic interventions modify HIPPO signaling. Aim 3. Evaluate the microenvironmental signals responsible for HIPPO pathway dysregulation and co-translation expression of activated YAP/TAZ protective mediators in HCM. Our approach includes determination of the time course of changes in coronary flow velocity, vascular/endothelial histology, and mechano-sensing through key components of the HIPPO pathway, with changes in cardiac function and the myofilaments Ca2+-response during HCM progression. We will treat mouse models early in HCM progression with S1PR agonists, and small molecule inhibitors to normalize myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and tension to examine whether they restore EC HIPPO pathway and angiogenic signaling. We will identity EC and CM specific disease signaling networks and determine whether HCM leads to impaired S1P export and paracrine function, by enriching and probing the ""functional co-translatome"" in the RiboTag reporter mice crossed with HCM mutations. Accomplishing our aims will provide discovery of targets for effective and individualized therapies for HCM.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2965,411,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01EY019041-16,Cortical Mechanisms of Visual Category Recognition and Learning,"Summary and Relevance of Proposed Research Humans have an impressive capacity to recognize the category membership of sensory stimuli. This ability, which is disrupted by a brain-based diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, stroke, and attention deficit disorder, is critical because it allows us to respond appropriately to the stimuli and events that we encounter in the environment. We are not born with an innate library of categories, such as “tables” and “chairs”, which we are preprogrammed to recognize. Instead, we learn to recognize familiar categories through experience. Our recent work has shown that both the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are involved in categorical decisions. We recorded from neurons in PPC and PFC during performance of visual motion categorization tasks. These recordings revealed that neurons in both areas robustly encoded stimuli according to their learned category membership, suggesting that both regions are involved in computing and representing abstract categorical information about visual stimuli. We also showed that activity in PPC is causally related to categorical decisions, using reversible inactivation. This project uses novel brain recording techniques to monitor the activity of large neuronal populations of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye field, and superior colliculus during visual categorical decisions. This will allow us to gain a mechanistic understanding of how interactions between neurons in these three regions enable computations which transform visual feature encoding into categorical decisions. This work will also determine how multiple behavioral functions are mediated by this brain network, including eye movements and spatial attention, as well assess the causal significance of each brain area to categorical decisions. While much is known about how the brain processes visual features (such as color, orientation, and direction of motion), less is known about how the brain learns and represents the meaning, or category, of stimuli. A greater understanding of visual categorization is critical for addressing a number of brain diseases and conditions (e.g. stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, and stroke) that leave patients impaired in everyday tasks that require visual learning, recognition and/or evaluating and responding appropriately to sensory information. The long-term goal of this project is to guide the next generation of treatments for these brain-based diseases and disorders by helping to develop a detailed understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie learning, memory and recognition. These studies also have relevance for understanding and addressing learning disabilities, such as attention deficit disorder and dyslexia, which affect a substantial fraction of school age children and young adults. Thus, a detailed understanding of the basic brain mechanisms of categorical decisions and attention will likely give important insights into the causes and potential treatments for disorders involving these cognitive and perceptual abilities.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3165,451,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01AI153059-06,Intercellular Communication and Pheromone Maturation in Gram-Positive Bacteria.,"Project Summary Gram-positive bacteria process and release small peptides, or “pheromones”, that act as critical signals for the induction of adaptive traits including those involved in virulence. One class of small signaling pheromones is the cyclic auto-inducing peptide (AIP), which regulates the expression of genes that orchestrate virulence and persistence in Staphylococci, Listeria, Clostridia, and Enterococci. Defects in cyclic AIP production and signaling can compromise virulence traits of these microbes, underscoring the relevance of peptide-based signaling to health and disease. Staphylococcus aureus harbors a cyclic peptide signaling system known as the accessory gene regulatory (Agr) system. This “quorum sensing” system depends on the synthesis, processing, and export of a cyclic AIP, derived from its precursor protein, AgrD, for function. AIP signaling through Agr leads to the production of S. aureus virulence factors, whereas disruption of signaling causes significant attenuation in skin and lung infection models. Despite clear connections between Agr and S. aureus pathobiology, there exist major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanics of AIP biosynthesis. Most notably: (i) the proteins needed for peptide processing of AIP have not been elucidated; (ii) a transporter for AIP or its leader peptide has not been identified; (iii) differential processing of AIP variants has not been investigated; and (iv) conservation in cyclic peptide processing events between bacterial species is not known. In this grant, we provide data related to our discovery of a putative peptidase in S. aureus, MroQ, that we hypothesize acts directly or indirectly on Agr system components to promote the final steps in the processing and/or export of AIP. The overall goals of this grant are to interrogate the previously unknown mechanics of cyclic peptide maturation in S. aureus and provide insight into the potential conservation of function in Gram positive pathogens. Aim 1 will define how MroQ promotes AIP processing, export, or both. Aim 2 will interrogate the extent with which MroQ interacts with Agr system or other membrane components and will use biochemistry to test if MroQ directly cleaves AgrD. Aim 3 will determine the extent with which MroQ promotes activity of Agr variants both within species and among other species and identify the AgrD sequence characteristics that dictate MroQ specificity.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2426,364,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5T32GM144292-03,Molecular and Cellular Biology Training Program,"The rapid emergence of novel ideas and technologies is transforming molecular and cellular biology into an increasingly quantitative and interdisciplinary science, opening additional research avenues but also creating challenges for graduate training. Meanwhile, increased recognition of the barriers faced by some students has prompted reevaluation of best practices in graduate education and mentorship. To embrace these new challenges and opportunities, we propose a new implementation of the Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) training program at the University of Chicago. The primary goals are to train a diverse body of interdisciplinary molecular and cellular biologists, to arm them with the modern quantitative and computational skills needed to carry out rigorous and reproducible science, and to prepare them for success in academia, industry, and other research-related careers. The new MCB program will unite an exceptional group of 55 faculty trainers who span a range of relevant fields and share a deep commitment to graduate training. We request 20 slots to support trainees from a large pool of highly qualified students belonging mainly to four core graduate programs: (1) Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, (2) Cell and Molecular Biology, (3) Development, Regeneration and Stem Cell Biology, and (4) Microbiology. The new MCB program will play a unique role by integrating interdisciplinary research and training in molecular and cellular biology across these graduate programs. Building on the success of the previous MCB program, which ends this year, the new MCB program will serve as an institution-leading driver of innovation and excellence in graduate training. MCB trainees will be supported primarily in Years 2 and 3, but they will participate in program activities from matriculation to graduation. A new quantitative curriculum will provide them with robust, rigorous, and customizable instruction in statistical and computational data analysis and modeling. Expansion and enhancement of a previous Research in Progress series will provide MCB trainees with team-mentored training in scientific communication, and will broaden participation to additional students in MCB trainers' labs. A division-wide career development program, and a student-run MCB Symposium featuring MCB alumni, will help students to explore different career paths. The MCB program will promote excellence in mentorship through required activities that include mentoring compacts and annual faculty mentorship training. Additional guidance for MCB trainees will be provided by annual meetings with the MCB program directors. Finally, the MCB program and its participating faculty will promote the recruitment and retention of an increasingly diverse scientific community through involvement in pipeline, outreach, and bridge programs, and through participation in graduate admissions and faculty recruitment. Professionally implemented evaluation tools will guide iterative improvements to the MCB program.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3018,429,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01AI159290-03,The role of TRIM2 and SIRPA in New World Arenavirus entry,"New world hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses (NWAs), such as Junín virus, are rodent-transmitted viruses that cause ~30% mortality when they zoonose into humans. The mechanism by the NWAs induce disease is still not certain, although it likely includes induction of high levels of cytokines by infected sentinel cells of the immune system, leading to endothelia and thrombocyte dysfunction and neurological disease. Survivors of Junín infection develop strong humoral immune responses, suggesting that controlling infection at early times post-infection is critical for virus clearance. Although an effective Junín virus vaccine has decreased disease incidence, sporadic cases of this as well as the other known and novel NWAs for which there are no vaccines or effective therapeutics still occur. It is well-established that the clade B pathogenic NWAs bind to transferrin receptor 1 and other receptors on the cell surface, but the steps leading to their entry from an acidic cellular compartment are not well-determined. We recently performed a siRNA screen with pseudotyped viruses bearing a pathogenic Junín glycoprotein with the goal of finding host genes involved in entry that could serve as therapeutic targets. We found that TRIM2, a member of the tripartite motif family that includes well-known members of the host's intrinsic defense against viral infections, limits NWA endocytosis into cells. By probing the TRIM2 interactome for other host proteins that block NWA infection, we discovered that SIRPA, a cell surface protein that inhibits macrophage phagocytosis of tumor and dead cells and erythrocytes, also decreases infection. Importantly, SIRPA, unlike TRIM2, inhibits infection by various human pathogenic viruses that require trafficking to an acidic compartment, including VSV, Zika virus, LCMV and Ebola and SARS-Cov-2 pseudoviruses. Our data suggest that TRIM2 and SIRPA act at the viral entry/internalization step. These finding suggests that there are common mechanisms that regulate virus endocytosis and phagocytosis. We propose here to further investigate the overlap between virus-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo in three aims that will 1) investigate the overlap in the NWA entry and phagocytosis pathways; 2) determine where TRIM2/SIRPA inhibition of infection occurs; and 3) use TRIM2, SIRPA and other relevant knockout mice to probe the roles of these proteins in cell-type specific and in vivo infection by replication-competent NWAs. In addition to providing mechanistic insight into the entry of NWAs into cells, these studies have the potential of increasing our understanding as to how host factors limit infection and could lead to new approaches to therapeutic intervention.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2748,409,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R35GM141479-04,Coordination of intracellular trafficking pathways by Ypt/Rab GTPases and their GEFs.,"In the three major intracellular trafficking pathways–exocytosis, endocytosis and autophagy–proteins and membranes are secreted, internalized or shuttled for degradation, respectively. These pathways are regulated by the conserved Ypt/Rab GTPases that when activated by nucleotide exchangers (GEFs), recruit their effectors to membranes. These effectors are machinery components that mediate vesicular transport steps, from vesicle formation, through motility and targeting, to fusion. I have worked in the Ypt/Rab field since its inception and contributed to the formulation of principles that underlie their mode of action. These include ideas that they function in “GTPase modules”, which contain GEF/s, a GTPase, and effector/s, to organize pathway- or step-specific membrane microdomains. While mechanisms underlying Ypt/Rab function are currently known, questions regarding pathway and step coordination remain open. We propose that Ypt/Rab GTPases coordinate intracellular trafficking at three levels: Coordination of multiple pathways, integration of transport steps into whole pathways, and coordination of vesicular transport sub-steps of individual transport steps. The proposed research relies on our recent findings using yeast as a model system, and we will continue using yeast due to its smaller proteome that results in a much smaller interactome, which is important for exploring the following coordination issues: Multiple pathways coordination: I propose that Ypt/Rabs coordinate autophagy with secretion and endocytosis at two intersections. In the first, Ypt1/Rab1 is required for the beginning of secretion and autophagy in the context of two different GTPase modules. In the second intersection, merging of endocytosis and late autophagy is regulated by a shared Vps21/Rab5 GTPase module. Here, we will determine whether cells prioritize certain pathways under different environmental conditions and how such a priority is promoted. Integration of transport steps: Here, we will address two major questions: First, how do Ypts regulate the beginning of a pathway, especially when a single GTPase functions in the context of two different modules? Second, what are the specific mechanisms by which Ypts coordinate early and late steps in secretion and autophagy? Coordination of vesicular transport sub-steps: We will explore late steps of the secretory and autophagy pathways, for which members of the GTPase modules are known, and ask how effectors that function sequentially are recruited. We will use classical and molecular genetics combined with cell biology and biochemistry approaches to address these questions. An efficient and well-coordinated network of cellular trafficking pathways is important for all the systems of the human body, and even a minor defect can result in a severe disease. Ypt/Rabs in general were implicated in a spectrum of acquired and inherited diseases, and those we study were associated with cancer and neurodegeneration. Finally, we recently showed the value of yeast modeling in understanding how a conserved protein variant causes a neurodevelopmental disorder.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3125,447,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5U01AI160406-04,Targeting trained immunity and Th1/Th17 axis with combination adjuvants,"The lack of effective vaccines against most infectious diseases is largely a result of our fundamental lack of understanding of mechanisms involved in protective immunity. Adjuvants incorporated into vaccine formulations have a major impact on vaccine efficacy via modulating and prolonging host immune responses; however, our understanding of their underlying mechanism(s) of action in driving specific immune parameters is incomplete. While vaccines are the most effective way to prevent and control infectious diseases, many pathogens that significantly impact human health remain without an effective vaccine. For example, one-fourth of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB)1, the leading infectious disease killer in the world. It is likely that for TB, and other major infectious diseases (e.g. AIDS and malaria), new adjuvants or adjuvant combinations will be essential for instructing a protective immune response. We and others have shown that targeting both the type 1 T helper (Th1) cells and type 17 T helper (Th17) cells enhance vaccine-induced immunity for TB5-8. Additionally, we have recently demonstrated that live vaccines (e.g. BCG) and adjuvants (e.g. β-glucan) generate innate memory response, termed trained immunity, via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes/macrophages, thereby conferring protection against Mtb infection9,10. These data together suggest that combination adjuvants targeting both innate trained immunity and adaptive Th1/Th17 cellular responses can enhance protective immunity against pathogens. Thus, defining the mechanisms of action of combination adjuvants that generate potent trained immunity and protective Th1/Th17 axis, are the overall goals of this proposal. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that combinations of adjuvants that drive Th1 responses (AS01 or UM-1007, a novel TLR7/8 agonist) and Th17 responses (β- glucan, nanoemulsion, or UM-1098, a novel Mincle agonist) will result in Th1/Th17 adaptive responses and/or enhance trained immunity. We will achieve these overall goals through the following four Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms by which combination adjuvants elicit Th1/Th17 immune responses. Specific Aim 2. To determine the impact of combination adjuvants on hematopoietic stem cells and trained immunity. Specific Aim 3. To determine whether use of combination adjuvants improves recall Th1/Th17 responses and trained immunity upon challenge. Specific Aim 4. Determine the mechanism of action of combination adjuvants in a pre-clinical human-like rhesus macaque model. Together, the aims of this study will map out the pathways induced by combination of adjuvants that effectively drive Th1/Th17 responses and trained immunity. Through Mtb challenge studies, we will demonstrate whether the mechanisms by which Th1/Th17 and trained immunity are elicited are involved in protection against pathogen challenge. While we will use TB as a model system, we envision that dissecting the mechanism of adjuvants-mediated immunity has broader impact on many other infectious diseases.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3164,448,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL073965-17,Cholesterol Regulation of Endothelial K+ Channels,"Dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction plays a major role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. Our studies discovered that plasma hypercholesterolemia results in suppression of endothelial inwardly- rectifying K+ (Kir) channels and that Kir channels play a major role in endothelial response to flow. Our long term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for cholesterol-induced regulation of endothelial ion channels and determine the impact of cholesterol-induced suppression of Kir on vascular function and atherosclerosis development. During the previous funding period of this grant, we discovered a new mode of cholesterol-Kir2 interactions via multiple dynamic contacts, provided direct evidence that Kir2.1 plays a crucial role in flow-induced vasodilation and NO release, and showed that hypercholesterolemia-induced impairment of flow-induced vasodilation can be attributed to Kir2.1 suppression. In the current proposal, we extend these studies to address three new goals: In Aim 1, we address the fundamental question of how cholesterol binding to the specific binding sites that we have already identified translates into the inhibition of channel gating. Specifically, we address a novel hypothesis based on our computational studies predicting that cholesterol binding uncouples specific residues within the channels, crucial for the gating process. This hypothesis will be addressed using a combination of multi-scale Molecular Dynamics simulations, a state-of-the-art computational approach, followed by site-directed mutagenesis, functional analysis of the channel function by high throughput electrophysiology, and biochemical and neutron scattering studies to evaluate direct cholesterol interactions with Kir2 channels. In Aim 2, we will extend our studies to determine the role of cholesterol suppression of Kir2.1 in two major endothelial flow responses: 1) activation of PECAM1/Src/VEGFR2/PI3K/Akt signaling axis and 2) cytoskeleton remodeling. This aim is based on our RNA sequencing analysis that revealed a major role of Kir2.1 in flow-sensitive gene expression including the expression of PECAM1/VEGFR2 mechanosensor complex. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that suppression of endothelial Kir channels by hypercholesterolemic conditions impairs flow-induced activation of VEGFR2 and activation of a small GTPase, RhoA, and alters flow-induced cytoskeletal remodeling. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the role of endothelial Kir2.1 in lesion formation of dyslipidemic mice. We have already established that the global deficiency of Kir2.1 exaggerates lesion formation in dyslipidemic ApoE-/- mice. In the proposed study, we will determine if the effect is specific for endothelial Kir2.1. Furthermore, we will also employ a new model of Kir2.1 rescue, a transgenic CRISPR mouse that expresses a cholesterol-insensitive Kir2.1 mutant. We believe that taken together, these studies will make a significant contribution to the understanding of cholesterol regulation of ion channels, dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction, and the mechanisms of lesion formation.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3124,428,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01CA258683-02,Adaptation and implementation of a patient navigation program for cervical cancer screening across contexts in Senegal,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT Cervical cancer mortality is expected to increase by 42% to 442,926 deaths worldwide by 2030. Currently 85% of incident cervical cancers and 87% of cervical cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Due in large part to the low utilization of cervical cancer screening services, Senegal ranks 17th in the world for cervical cancer incidence. For women ages 40 to 49 in rural regions of the country the cervical cancer screening rate is very low at less than 2%. As a result women often present with mostly preventable late stage cancers. Secondary prevention programs (cervical cancer screening) are critical to effectively achieving global progress toward the elimination of human papillomavirus related cancers. However, considerable context variation across geographic- and health system-levels in LMICs markedly obstructs the community responsiveness of an implemented program. Lessons learned from higher resource countries show that incidence and mortality rates decline and early deaths are prevented with early detection and appropriate follow- up and treatment. Prior efforts and pilot studies in Senegal show that there is slow uptake, poor follow-up, and low treatment rates for women who are screened positive. Patient navigation is a strategy to eliminate barriers to screening, timely diagnosis, and follow-up to improve cancer outcomes in vulnerable populations. In high-income countries, patient navigation has demonstrated considerable effectiveness in its ability to address communication, information, medical system, and emotional barriers to timely care across all phases of the cancer care continuum, including detection, diagnosis, treatment, and post-treatment quality of life. Patient navigation programs enhance access to care, promote self-efficacy, and sustain patient engagement with care, and have been shown to improve cancer outcomes, particularly among marginalized groups, rural populations, and impoverished communities. The goal of this project is to prevent unnecessary deaths due to cervical cancer in Senegal. This mixed methods research responds to identified intrapersonal- and community-level barriers to early cervical cancer screening uptake, follow-up, and treatment among women there. We will apply the Dynamic Adaptation Process to study the adaptation of an evidence-based cervical cancer patient navigation program in urban and rural contexts of Senegal, measure the intervention effectiveness, and evaluate programmatic implementation outcomes. By studying the process of adaptation of a patient navigation program in a low- and middle-income country, we will apply implementation science to a novel context. With a particular focus on how the adaptation responds to cancer-related stigma and women’s autonomy in healthcare decision-making, our project demonstrates additional innovation. The process knowledge generated will further our long-term goal to inform the national cervical cancer prevention and control programs in Senegal and other low- and middle-income countries.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3075,433,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DK132398-02,Regulation of beige adipocyte maintenance and its impact on metabolic outcomes,"Title: Regulation of beige adipocyte maintenance and its impact on metabolic outcomes Project Summary/Abstract A potential therapeutic target to curb the global obesity and diabetes epidemic is thermogenic beige fat within white adipose tissue (WAT). Unlike white adipocyte which stores fat, beige adipocytes are stimulated thermogenic fat cells in WAT that robustly consume lipid and glucose. However, Beige adipocytes quickly disappear upon the removal of stimuli, a process further accelerated by age and obesity. This creates a key challenge to explore beige adipocytes as a sustainable therapy for chronic metabolic diseases. A long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand the development and maintenance of beige adipocytes, and the metabolic outcomes. In our preliminary studies using unique mouse models, we demonstrate that beige adipocytes can be induced and maintained by pharmacological and genetical measures. Further, our preliminary results suggest that these induced beige adipocytes are maintained in the older mice, even without continuous stimulation. These exciting findings, although preliminary in nature, suggest novel measures to use beige adipocyte as potential therapeutics to treat obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases. In this application, we will investigate whether the sustained beige adipocytes can improve the metabolic fitness under both health and disease conditions, thereby achieving anti-obesity and anti-diabetes effects. Furthermore, we will elucidate the critical molecular mechanisms by which beige adipocyte identity is preserved. In addition, we will employ cell- type selective transcriptomic approach to comprehensively characterize the molecular components involved in beige adipocyte maintenance.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,1759,243,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01MH087214-15,Neural indices of online and offline states in human working memory,"PROJECT SUMMARY Visual working memory is a central cognitive system for maintaining active representations about currently relevant information. Individual differences in working memory ability reflect a core cognitive ability, as shown by robust correlations with fluid intelligence, scholastic achievement and other broad measures of intellectual function. Furthermore, working memory deficits are a signature of many prevalent mental health disorders, such as attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and depression. Thus, a detailed understanding of this system is important for understanding the cognitive effects of these disorders, and for precise assessments of the efficacy of clinical interventions. The broad goal of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neural signals that index storage in this online memory system, and to use those signals to refine cognitive models of human memory. A key recent discovery is that the electrophysiological signals that index storage in working memory can be divided into two distinct categories. One class of activity tracks the number of discrete “items” or objects that are stored in working memory, without regard to the specific information associated with each object. A second class of activity instead tracks the spatial positions that are currently prioritized in the visual field, without regard to the number of independent objects occupying those positions. The proposed work will pursue this insight, refining both neural and cognitive models of human working memory. Finally, while working memory plays a critical role in complex cognition, there is a clear consensus that working memory must interact with qualitatively different memory systems (e.g., long term memory) that store information “offline” or out of mind. While past work has often sought paradigms that allow a “pure” assessment of working memory or long term memory, there is a strong need for work that directly examines the dynamic collaboration between these systems. Thus, a central theme of this project will be to identify the specific factors that encourage transitions between online and offline memory states. Specifically, the proposal will follow up on past work showing that observers divide up ongoing continuous experiences into discrete “event” representations, and that the boundaries between events influence which pieces of information are integrated and segregated in memory. This project will use time-resolved electrophysiological measures of storage in working memory to determine whether event boundaries prompt the flushing of online memories to make way for information about subsequent events, even when there is adequate capacity for concurrent storage. This will provide new insight into the specific cognitive operations that determine how limited online memory capacity is deployed in complex cognitive tasks.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2905,424,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HD100023-04,Resolving Spatiotemporally-Specific Multicellular Dynamics In Vivo During Olfactory Neurogenesis,"Project Summary While many neurological defects and disorders are known to result from developmental perturbations in specific cell types and/or are linked to well-studied signaling pathways, the system-level coordination of multiple cell populations and the spatiotemporal specificity of their signaling outputs during neurogenesis remains poorly understood. The long-term objective of this proposal is to take advantage of the accessible and rapidly developing zebrafish olfactory epithelium to quantitatively characterize cell-cell signaling pathways and multicellular behaviors that drive the assembly of complex neuronal populations in vertebrates. Proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways provide spatially- and temporally- sensitive cues to guide stem cell migration into the olfactory epithelium and regulate sensory neurogenesis. Small subsets of cells will be manipulated and analyzed completely in vivo, at subcellular spatial resolution and with sub-minute temporal resolution, so as to determine the system-level coordination of stem cell migration, specification, and differentiation during both normal and disrupted signaling. First, new tools and techniques will be used to perturb Wnt signaling in vivo at specific times and locations during olfactory development and to algorithmically model and explain progenitor cells’ migratory behavior. Next, Notch signaling will be manipulated in vivo to quantitate its effects on olfactory system-wide neurogenesis, and target genes will be identified that are required for neuronal specification and/or differentiation. Finally, the transcription factor insm1a will be similarly investigated to determine its role in Notch signaling-mediated olfactory neurogenesis. The approaches in this proposal will directly analyze in vivo data to understand and predict multicellular behavior without reducing biological complexity and help uncover phenotypes that may advance our broad understanding of system-wide neuronal differentiation and assembly in vivo.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2058,276,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5T32HD055164-15,Training Program in Developmental Biology,"The core mission of the pre-doctoral Developmental Biology Training Program (DBTP) is to produce highly qualified, independent research scientists who are trained to take a broad interdisciplinary approach to developmental biology problems. This mission is consistent with the philosophy of the University of Chicago's Biological Sciences Division (BSD), which seeks to avoid artificial boundaries between disciplines and encourage broad based interaction and collaboration. The interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the DBTP is enhanced by the BSD's structure: researchers in all clinical and basic science departments are housed in close proximity and united under one administrative and intellectual framework. The DBTP trainers are a vibrant group of thirty-six well-funded researchers, including experienced senior faculty and talented junior faculty, based in nine BSD departments (basic science and clinical) and two adjacent Physical Sciences departments. To produce researchers trained in a variety of areas relevant to human health and disease, the DBTP builds on both long-standing and burgeoning University of Chicago strengths in developmental biology. We have well-established strengths in the genetics of model organisms, the cellular basis of development, and evolutionary developmental biology. During this second funding period, strategic new hires have enabled the program to expand its research strengths in stem cell biology, the use of computation/modeling/systems level approaches in developing systems, and in particular developmental neurobiology, a research area that is being positively influenced by the new University of Chicago Grossman Institute for Neuroscience, Quantitative Biology and Human Behavior. DBTP trainees are carefully selected from six interdisciplinary graduate training programs: training grant support begins as they enter their second year of studies and generally extends for two years, subject to competitive renewal. We propose to continue to support four trainees for the next two years, and then increase that number to five trainees in years 3-5 to take advantage of the expanding pool of students with interests in developmental neurobiology. This number of trainees will allow us to be highly selective, while maintaining a critical cohort size. Trainees benefit from a strategically designed curriculum that includes access to six dedicated formal courses in developmental biology, a new requirement for quantitative training, and an extensive range of supplemental training-related activities. Among these activities are the DBTP sponsored developmental biology seminar series and journal/data in progress club (plus associated new communications course), an annual retreat, and regular student-run DBTP-sponsored symposia. In summary, the DBTP integrates a wide range of varied training approaches to prepare future leaders in developmental biology research and education.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2941,410,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1T32DK131958-01A1,An Interdisciplinary Molecular Metabolism Training Program,"PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic disease is a massive worldwide health problem as illustrated by the current epidemics in obesity and type 2 diabetes, which is especially prominent in the United States and showing no sign of abating. As such, there is an urgent need for metabolism research to face this alarming situation. However, there are relatively few training programs across the country specifically dedicated to the training of bright young predoctoral researchers in metabolism at the systemic, cellular and molecular level. To address this need we have set up the Molecular Metabolism Training Program (MMTP) at the University of Chicago, which incorporates the Committee on Molecular Metabolism & Nutrition (CMMN) and thus is one of the few graduate programs in the United States granting a PhD in molecular metabolism. A successful training program in metabolism requires a multi- and inter-disciplinary approach, made up of researchers with a wide variety of technical skills and research experience. The MMTP takes advantage of the marvelous and highly interactive biomedical environment and strong traditions in metabolic and diabetes research at the University of Chicago. The trainers in the MMTP, in whose laboratories MMTP trainees will conduct their research projects, have primary appointments across many departments and sections of the Biological Sciences Division, but have a unifying interest in understanding the causes and potential therapies for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, from molecular, metabolic and/or immunologic viewpoints. Being interdepartmental, the MMTP pre-doctoral trainees can take courses and gain experience in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Genetics, Medicine, Immunology, Physiology and Neurobiology with a required comprehensive specialized metabolism core- curriculum. Trainees must also attend metabolism journal clubs, data sessions, seminar series, and an annual multi-disciplinary retreat. Participation in National and International metabolism, diabetes and/or obesity scientific meetings is expected. There is strong institutional support, as well as a significant allocation of new research space and equipment for the MMTP. Many outstanding applicants currently apply to the CMMN and Biomedical Science Cluster (Immunology, Microbiology and Cancer Biology), and the recruitment success rate into these programs is high. Pre-doctoral trainees recently graduated from the CMMN have found postdoctoral positions in foremost academic metabolism research laboratories and some have moved on to establish their own academic research groups, which we expect to continue under the MMTP. The ultimate goal of the MMTP is to set up young researchers on the path to become independent academic diabetes research scientists and mentors themselves – dedicated to excellent scholarship and making breakthrough discoveries in that will lead to new therapies to better treat, prevent and perhaps even cure these disorders.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2972,428,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

Candidates for T32 training are nationally recruited through Residency Matching program to the Section of Hematology/Oncology within our Department of Medicine with the expectation that candidates for T32 training will complete one clinical year funded by the hospital and then have a minimum of two or three years of research training under the proposed training grant depending on whether they perform patient-oriented research or fundamental basic/translational/population research. The direction of the program – provision of multidisciplinary, structured, career development, mentoring and leadership opportunities in cancer research – has not changed since the program’s inception, but we have continued to evolve the program in response to a national need to develop and/or enhance research training opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds interested in team science and translational research. There are several unique structural elements in the research training proposed: 1) access to a diverse population of cancer patients; 2) training under the guidance of multidisciplinary research preceptor(s) within a robust scientific environment that provides innovative scientific approaches, tools and technologies; 3) specific educational pathways in the form of course work and special seminars leading to advanced degree or certificate from any relevant unit in the University; and 4) community engagement and service learning opportunities to accelerate progress in cancer research and promote health equity. The 33 Senior and 22 Clinical/Junior research training faculty preceptors have NIH or equivalent peer- reviewed funding, interact on a number of collaborative research and training efforts and are well qualified to serve as potential mentors for the six trainees per year participating in this T32 program. Our extensive inpatient and outpatient facilities promote a comprehensive clinical training experience, while our research laboratories allow for the acquisition of basic research skills. With significant investments in new cancer programs and enhanced facilities, we have revamped our curriculum to offer coursework in emerging areas of cancer research including chemical biology, proteo-genomics, metabolomics, data science, implementation science and global oncology. In addition to leadership experience and entrepreneurship, our diverse populations in Chicago and our global partners will provide opportunities in community engaged research to advance novel interventions to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes.

The project will be implemented in close collaboration with the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) and selected US as well as local academic institutions to continue and augment complementary training expertise relevant to this proposal. The goal of the Bangladesh GEOHealth Center was to strengthen the research capacity of Bangladesh on pressing environmental and occupational health threats. During the current funding period, the Bangladesh GEOHealth Center has positively impacted on the foundation of environmental health research capacity in Bangladesh by training more than 200 students, young and mid-career researchers from diverse background through custom-designed in-country 2-day workshops and 2-week short-courses, and 16 fellows through US- based postdoctoral fellowships and 12-week (one academic quarter) training at the UofC. Evaluation of short courses and workshops in Bangladesh indicated increased knowledge and high satisfaction of the participants. The 16 fellows who received training at UofC have demonstrated outstanding research productivity in term of publications, presentations, grants, and career development. They produced 90 peer-reviewed publications during and after the training period. All 16 US-based fellows reported that they had cooperative and influential, mentor(s) during the training period and the trainees continued to receive guidance from the mentor(s) even after completion of the training. Despite these demonstrable impacts there remains a critical need for additional research capacity in Bangladesh to address the country’s huge environmental and occupational health burden given the acute shortage of researchers trained in modern environmental health research methods, especially data science and mHealth tools and techniques. In this renewal application, we propose to continue and augment our Bangladesh and US- based training activities through i. Workshops (2 day), ii. Short courses (1-2 week) iii. One academic quarter course work at UofC, iv. A master’s degree program (1-year) at UofC, and v. Postdoctoral training (1-year) at UofC. We will refine the training curricula that we used over the past 5 years to incorporate more materials on utilizing advanced technologies and analytical tools (artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), image analysis, mobile health (mHealth) data capture/analytics, exposure data science, etc.) for analyzing environmental health data with the existing materials, all of which will incorporate the linked U01 application’s research focus. A rigorous evaluation system will help the Administrative and External Oversight Committee to monitor and ensure program success.

1R01CA279802-01,Tumor-Targeted Multimodality Nanoscale Coordination Polymers for Chemo-Immunotherapy of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,"Project Summary: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. The majority of CRC patients have distant or regional metastasis and a poor prognosis. Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has demonstrated favorable responses and survival benefits for mCRC patients with mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient or microsatellite instability (MSI)-high tumors, it does not benefit approximately 95% of mCRC patients who have MMR-proficient (pMMR) or MSI-low lesions. There is an urgent need for methods that can sensitize pMMR/MSI-low CRC, improve recognition and presentation of tumor-associated antigens, and activate T-cell proliferation and responses for synergistic combination with ICB to overcome current limitations in clinical care for mCRC patients. We have pioneered the development of nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) for cancer therapy. Formed by coordination polymerization between metal ions and polydentate ligands, NCPs preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues by taking advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention effect and possess several advantages over existing nanotherapeutics. The long-term goal of our research is to establish a new treatment paradigm for metastatic colorectal cancer through the development and characterization of NCPs that can be delivered systemically. We have developed OX/SN38 NCP with a hydrophilic oxaliplatin (OX) prodrug in the core and a hydrophobic SN38 prodrug on the shell. Tumor-targeted and -activated OX/SN38 demonstrated potent anticancer effect and synergized with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (αPD-L1) for strong chemo-immunotherapy in CRC models. We have also developed a robust NCP for the co-delivery of OX and 2’,3’-cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) agonist of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to tumors. OX/cGAMP significantly prolonged the half-life of cGAMP in circulation and disrupted tumor vasculatures to enhance tumor accumulation. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to develop a tumor-targeted core-shell NCP, OX/CDN/Chol-D, through the optimization of CDN and cholesterol-conjugated drug (Chol-D) separately, for the co-delivery of OX and Chol-D to cause tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) and the release of CDN for STING activation in the tumor microenvironment. We will elucidate the mechanisms of enhanced drug delivery to tumors via LDLR- mediated endocytosis and tumor vasculature disruption by OX/CDN/Chol-D and evaluate its anticancer efficacy alone and in combination with αPD-L1 in multiple CRC models. By creating an immunogenic tumor microenvironment, activating STING, and eliciting T-cell mediated cytotoxicity, OX/CDN/Chol-D promises to turn immunologically “cold” CRC tumors “hot” for synergistic combination with ICB to improve immunotherapy of mCRC. Our close collaborations on this multidisciplinary project promise to identify a novel tri-modality nanomedicine for clinical translation to treat mCRC patients with a poor prognosis.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2980,414,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5K99DA054260-02,Development of a mobile health intervention for electronic cigarette use among young adults,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Despite declines in combustible cigarette smoking among young adults, use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), such as e-cigarettes, continues to rise. Young adulthood marks a particularly susceptible time for the experimentation and initiation of substance use behaviors, including tobacco. Further, some who initiate tobacco use with ENDS transition to combustible products, such as cigarettes or marijuana, or become users of multiple products (dual/poly users). Despite the addiction potential of ENDS and high interest in quitting among young adults , there are few resources available to help individuals quit or reduce their use of ENDS. The aim of the proposed research is to develop an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) text- message based intervention for young adult ENDS and dual (ENDS and cigarette) users (K99 phase 1), and determine whether the intervention is effective in reducing ENDS use (primary outcome) and increasing cessation , quit attempts, and use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; secondary outcomes; R00 phase 2). In phase 1 (K99), we will determine intervention content and delivery schedule based on existing evidence- based smoking cessation materials as well as utilize focus groups with young adult ENDS users (both ENDS- only and dual users) to adapt content to an mHealth ENDS-specific intervention. We will then run an initial pilot study with 45 participants to determine intervention feasibility and acceptability. After the pilot intervention, we will conduct additional focus groups with individuals who participated in the pilot to further refine the intervention. In phase 2 (R00), we will conduct a randomized control trial to determine the intervention’s effect on ENDS outcomes. Young adult ENDS and dual users will be randomized to one of three conditions: 1) mHealth ENDS intervention, 2) standard ENDS advice+NRT, or 3) standard advice alone . Standard advice will include a website that will be updated with information on products/safety and strategies for ENDS cessation as information evolves over the course of the study. Participants in the mHealth condition will complete a 6- week text-message based intervention with content tailored based on 1) motivation to quit ENDS, 2) whether an individual uses ENDS only or is a dual user of tobacco products, and 3) target quit date. Participants will complete an assessment of ENDS behaviors, quit attempts, and use of NRT at 3-month follow-up. ENDS use frequency will be the primary outcome , while biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence, NRT use, and quit attempts will be the secondary outcomes of interest. This study’s findings will inform emerging ENDS intervention literature, an area where a clear evidence base is currently lacking, and whether a mHealth intervention can impact young adults’ ENDS cessation, behaviors, and barriers to NRT use. This project will serve to provide valuable mentorship and training complementary to the proposed research to facilitate Dr. Brett’s transition to an independently-funded investigator and clinical addiction and tobacco control scientist.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3146,473,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL159558-02,Targeted Gene Delivery Systems Treating Lung Diseases,"Project Summary This R01 proposal outlines a research plan which uses targeted nanomedicine to enhance disease- modifying molecular mechanisms both in the acute injurious phase and in the subsequent chronic fibrotic phase of viral-induced pneumonitis. The overall goal of this proposal is to use nanomedicine to modify specific cellular subtypes during the lung disease process. Acute and chronic lung diseases are major causes of mortality and morbidity in the US. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), caused by widespread endothelial barrier disruption and uncontrolled cytokine storm, is the major cause of death in critically ill influenza and COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, pulmonary fibrosis, progressive scarring in injured lung, is a major sequelae of viral pneumonia. Early analyses showed that discharged COVID-19 patients are at high risk for developing pulmonary fibrosis. Currently, there are few pharmacological treatments that directly targets ARDS, and available therapeutic options for pulmonary fibrosis remain suboptimal, underscoring unmet medical needs in a heightened state due to COVID-19 pandemic. Strongly supported by our published and unpublished in vivo results, we believe that targeted nanomedicine approaches have tremendous potential to treat ARDS and pulmonary fibrosis, which will be comprehensively tested in vivo in this application. Aim 1 will test the therapeutic effectiveness of specifically reducing endothelial dysfunction in acute lung injury (influenza or SARS-CoV-2) in mice and perfused human lungs using a VCAM1-targeting, KLF2 mRNA-encapsulated nanoparticles. We anticipate that specific endothelial KLF2 overexpression will reduce acute lung injury. Aim 2 will test the therapeutic effectiveness of specifically targeting lung fibroblasts in chronic pulmonary fibrosis (bleomycin) in mice and human lung slices using PDGFRB-targeting nanoparticles to deliver shRNAs against TXNDC5. We anticipate that specific fibroblast inhibition of TXNDC5 will reduce lung fibrosis.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2025,280,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1U01NS131797-01,Implementation of a Stroke Protocol for Emergency Evaluation and Disposition (HI-SPEED),"Project Abstract Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year experience acute stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, almost half of the US population lives beyond a 60-minute drive of a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) and most patients are initially evaluated at a primary stroke center (PSC). While a key treatment, alteplase can be delivered at most US hospitals, advanced diagnostics and treatments are only available at CSCs. However, the PSC “Door-in-Door-Out” (DIDO) evaluation process for patients who need to be transferred to a CSC can be time consuming and inefficient, contributing to inability to receive treatment. Building upon our prior work to reduce PSC DIDO time, this proposal, “Implementation of a Stroke Protocol for Emergency Evaluation and Disposition (I-SPEED)” seeks to (1) Implement a novel, evidence-based, multi-component DIDO intervention in eight diverse stroke systems of care across multiple regions of the US and (2) Conduct a dual evaluation of its effectiveness in reducing median DIDO time (primary outcome) and disability (secondary outcome) and of the fidelity and quality of implementation. The I-SPEED study will definitively establish the effectiveness and generalizability of a multi-component evidence-based DIDO intervention and provide information about contextual adaptations for high-quality implementation and widespread dissemination. This study benefits from our well-established interdisciplinary expertise in stroke, emergency and prehospital medicine, systems and quality engineering, health services research, and strong multicenter research collaborations. Findings from I- SPEED will have substantial implications for a wide range of hospitals and stroke systems of care worldwide.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,1862,263,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HD099847-05,Optimizing prevention approaches for children reintegrating from orphanages in Azerbaijan,"The UN estimates that globally between 2 to 8 million children live in orphanages and the countries of the former Soviet Union (fSU) and Eastern Europe have the highest number of children in institutional care worldwide--up to 1.3 million children. Due to the economic crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan hosts a large population of “social orphans,” children left by destitute parents in state-run institutions. Years of deprivation, separation from parents, and maltreatment in orphanages severely heighten the risk of mental health problems among institutionalized children. However, current deinstitutionalization and family reunification initiatives provide basic case management services, but do not address the mental health problems of institutionalized children and do not attend to the poverty-related factors that led to institutionalization in the first place. To prevent mental health problems among 6-12 children from orphanages reunited with their biological or extended families in Azerbaijan, the proposed study will refine and test three evidence-based intervention approaches (a) family strengthening intervention; b) mental health screening and referral for treatment; and c) economic empowerment in the form of Child Savings Accounts). Based on the formative research conducted by the study team in collaboration with a local Community Collaborative Board, the intervention components have been adapted to maximize fit to the cultural context of Azerbaijan. In the proposed study, the adapted interventions will be tested with 400 child-caregiver dyads in a trial using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to compare different intervention components and identify the most optimal combination. The study will test effects of each intervention component on children's mental health outcomes (symptoms of depression, anxiety; disruptive behaviors; post-traumatic symptoms; and disturbances of attachment). If efficacious, the study results study could transform large-scale deinstitutionalization initiatives implemented by UNICEF or other organizations in Azerbaijan and in the fSU region. The study addresses top two challenges within the NIMH Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health Goal B (Advance prevention and implementation of early interventions): 1) to develop locally appropriate strategies to eliminate childhood abuse and 2) to develop interventions to reduce the long-term negative impact of low childhood socioeconomic status on mental health. Additionally, the goal of this R01 application is to strengthen the local research expertise in testing and adaptation of individual, family, and structural interventions for preventing child mental health problems. Through training and collaborative research, the project will enhance knowledge and skills in: 1) core components and mechanisms of change in preventive mental health interventions for children with a history of trauma, abuse and deprivation; 2) adaptation of multilevel evidence-based interventions and measurement tools to a new socio-cultural context of a fSU country; 3) methodological and statistical techniques for evaluating complex interventions with multiple components.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3208,446,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL045638-35,Programming of PMN host-defense function during transendothelial migration,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN or neutrophil) maintain human health by rapidly eliminating the invading pathogens. These circulating cells transmigrate across the endothelial adherens junctions (AJs) to enter into the infected tissue and to clear the pathogens. Little is known about the role of mechanical forces which PMN experience during transmigration across the endothelium. Our Supporting Data describe the potentially important role of adherens junctions in activating PMN’s host defense function. We observed that activation of PMN-expressed Piezo1 during paracellular transmutation induced calcium influx, which in turn, promptly stabilized Hif1α and upregulated expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) in PMN to program these cells to efficient “killers” of the pathogens. These findings have for the first time linked PMN-expressed Piezo1 to the host-defense function, leading to the fundamental question “how Ca2+ influx in PMN via Piezo1 program the host-defense function of PMN?” In Aim 1, we will determine the role of PMN-expressed Piezo1 signaling pathway in activating the host-defense function of transmigrating PMN. Here we will delineate the signaling pathways downstream of Piezo1 activation that promptly stabilizes Hif1α in PMN and programs PMN to become more efficient bacterial “killers”. The studies will involve genetic analysis of Piezo1- Hif1α signaling of the transmigrating PMN such as PMN-specific Piezo1 and Hif1α knockout mice. We will also determine whether pharmacological activation of Piezo1 or expression of gain-of-function Piezo1 mutant in PMN is sufficient to activate the PNM defense system in the relevant P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia model. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of PMN-expressed Nox4 in regulating oxidative and lytic properties of PMN and in the efficient elimination of pathogens in lung. These studies will address the function of Nox4 in PMN in the mechanism of innate immune defense program. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, we will determine how Hif1α induces activation of Nox4 gene and how Nox4 regulates oxidative and lytic properties of phagolysosome and efficient pathogen killing. The proposed studies will be essential for understanding the regulation of PMN host-defense function with the goal of identifying therapeutic potential of Piezo1 activators.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2366,346,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5F99CA274689-02,Myeloid cell-expressed PTPN22 and anti-tumor immunity,"PROJECT SUMMARY Immunotherapies that block the checkpoint molecules programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 have revolutionized cancer treatment; however, a significant number of patients display resistance to immunotherapy, either de novo or with disease relapse after initial response [1-3]. Immunotherapy-refractory cases have prompted insight into mechanisms of resistance, which should ultimately lead to new strategies to expand clinical efficacy. Primary resistance is linked to lack of immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment (TME), an observation which has prompted deeper investigation into the tumor and host factors that regulate the degree of spontaneous T cell activation and infiltration into tumor sites. One relevant source of inter-patient heterogeneity is the variable presence of polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune-regulatory genes, many of which have been linked previously to the propensity towards autoimmunity. In the F99 phase of this proposed plan, I will evaluate the utility of targeting an autoimmune-associated gene to increase immunotherapy efficacy. A SNP in the tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene is attributed with the greatest risk for autoimmune disease outside mutations in the human leukocyte antigen locus [4-6]. PTPN22 negatively regulates the activation of multiple immune compartments, with loss-of-function variants leading to heightened immune cell activation in mice and humans [7-8]. This increase in immune activity is attributed to the expansion of activated CD8+ T cells, however, work reported to date have utilized global knockout mice (KO), confounding the specific role of PTPN22 in other cell lineages relevant for anti-tumor immunity, in particular myeloid cells. We thus developed a PTPN22fl/fl mouse to study its effect in different immune cell types via conditional KO mouse models. I hypothesize that loss of PTPN22 augments the ability of DCs to activate antigen specific CD8+ T cells through 1) improved priming in the tdLN or recruitment to and/or survival signaling in the TME and that 2) deletion of PTPN22 in macrophages also may potentiate anti-tumor immunity. In the K00 phase of the proposed plan, I aim to identify novel targets governing anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy efficacy by 1) identifying autoimmune related SNPs whose loss of function variants correlate with increased tumor immune infiltration and 2) characterizing the effect of these targets on tumor progression and immunotherapy response through functional studies using conditional KO mice. This work holds the potential to elucidate novel therapeutic targets to potentiate anti-tumor immunity. My ultimate goal is to become a tenure- track faculty member at a leading academic research institution and conduct NIH funded work contributing to the field of tumor immunology by elucidating anti-tumor immunity and developing novel immunotherapies.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2942,426,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5T32AI007090-45,Interdisciplinary Training Program in Immunology,"PROJECT SUMMARY: This training grant, currently in its 40th year of funding, represents the primary support for graduate students in the Immunology Training Program at the University of Chicago. The program functions in a diverse environment where the basic biological sciences and the medical school are integrated within the same division in a single campus in Hyde Park, Chicago, IL. It is embodied by the Committee on Immunology, an interdisciplinary and interdepartmental academic unit that serves as the scientific community for immunology graduate students, postdocs, and faculty at the University. The faculty of our Training Program is composed of 34 distinguished trainers selected for their outstanding research and training records, their well- funded laboratories and their dynamic involvement in all aspects of the program. They form a diverse, age- and gender-balanced group whose research spans a broad spectrum of modern areas of immunology including cellular and molecular immunology, biochemistry, genomics, systems biology, microbiome studies, molecular engineering, and human immunology, with a proven record of interdisciplinary collaborations. New strength is drawn from the recent recruitment of five internationally recognized senior faculty with expertise in immunoengineering and immunogenetics, as well as three junior faculty with expertise in systems immunology, mucosal immunology, and myeloid disorders. Predoctoral students receive advanced training through courses focused on the critical analysis of primary literature and experimental design, with special emphasis on computational skills, rigor and reproducibility, and the responsible conduct of research. The comprehensive training includes a weekly Seminar Series, Work-in-Progress forum, and Journal Club, as well as an annual Joint Immunology Retreat held with other top immunology programs in the Midwest. Career development is enhanced through MyChoice, an institutional program enabling trainees to further develop academic skills and gain exposure to a broad array of research-intensive career paths, as well as a partnership with the UChicago Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. The Biological Sciences Division provides strong institutional support, as shown by sustained financial and administrative support, the operation of cutting-edge core facilities such as gnotobiotics, and the implementation of major initiatives such as the Duchossois Family Institute, a new research institute aimed at harnessing the power of the microbiome and immunity for human health. The Program is continuously and rigorously evaluated with respect to organization, leadership, objectives and outcomes. This is one of the most outstanding and competitive training programs in the country, as shown by the high retention and completion rates of our trainees (which include many students from underrepresented minority backgrounds), their impressive publication rate (average of six publications per trainee, including many first-author publications in journals such as Nature, Immunity, Cell Host & Microbe, JEM, and PNAS), and their success in securing independent scientific careers.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3181,444,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1F31HL168912-01,Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Cardiac Organoids to Determine the Genetic Basis for Cell-Specific Responses to Anticancer Drugs,"PROJECT SUMMARY Anticancer drug-induced cardiovascular toxicity (CT) is a major side effect for many patients undergoing treatment for oncological disorders. CT symptoms vary widely across individuals, both in presentation and in time to onset. Risk of CT complicates treatment protocols and places cancer patients under additional duress. Genetic background is broadly understood to be a component of CT susceptibility, but specific variants and mechanisms remain largely unknown. To understand the genetic basis for drug-induced CT, we need to understand how anticancer drugs stimulate transcriptomic responses in multiple cardiovascular cell types from individuals of different genetic backgrounds. Inter-individual variability in response to anticancer drugs is mediated by genetic variants that affect gene regulation in a drug-dependent manner (response eQTLs). In other words, genetic variants respond to anticancer drugs by regulating the activity of specific genes. Notably, different cell types can vary in their response eQTLs to anticancer drugs. I propose to determine the genetic basis for transcriptomic responses to the anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and bevacizumab (BVC) in multiple cardiac cell types from a genetically diverse panel of 70 individuals. Identification of CT-associated response eQTLs necessitates a high-throughput model system comprised of multiple cardiac cell types. For Aim 1 of my proposal, I have developed a culture environment and guided differentiation protocol conducive to cardiac lineage and supporting cell types. This procedure reproducibly transforms induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) into cardiac organoids. Preliminary data demonstrate that the cardiac organoids harbor cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and other mesodermal cell types. In Aim 2, I will perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on a panel of 70 cardiac organoids cultured in control and drug-treated conditions. Repeating this experiment across multiple individuals will allow me to identify the response eQTLs that regulate how different cardiovascular cell types respond to each drug. In Aim 3, I will quantify gene expression levels and identify response eQTLs that regulate transcriptional changes to each anticancer drug in cardiovascular cell types. Response eQTLs (which are anchored by genotype) provide a catalog of loci that interact either directly or indirectly with the treatment. These response eQTLs may reveal specific genes and pathways important for normal cardiovascular function. Elucidating the genetic architecture underlying CT risk will provide intuition on cardiotoxic mechanisms and associated genes and inform future studies that aim to classify individual patient susceptibility.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2816,389,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
2R01EY019041-15,Cortical Mechanisms of Visual Category Recognition and Learning,"Summary and Relevance of Proposed Research Humans have an impressive capacity to recognize the category membership of sensory stimuli. This ability, which is disrupted by a brain-based diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, stroke, and attention deficit disorder, is critical because it allows us to respond appropriately to the stimuli and events that we encounter in the environment. We are not born with an innate library of categories, such as “tables” and “chairs”, which we are preprogrammed to recognize. Instead, we learn to recognize familiar categories through experience. Our recent work has shown that both the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are involved in categorical decisions. We recorded from neurons in PPC and PFC during performance of visual motion categorization tasks. These recordings revealed that neurons in both areas robustly encoded stimuli according to their learned category membership, suggesting that both regions are involved in computing and representing abstract categorical information about visual stimuli. We also showed that activity in PPC is causally related to categorical decisions, using reversible inactivation. This project uses novel brain recording techniques to monitor the activity of large neuronal populations of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye field, and superior colliculus during visual categorical decisions. This will allow us to gain a mechanistic understanding of how interactions between neurons in these three regions enable computations which transform visual feature encoding into categorical decisions. This work will also determine how multiple behavioral functions are mediated by this brain network, including eye movements and spatial attention, as well assess the causal significance of each brain area to categorical decisions. While much is known about how the brain processes visual features (such as color, orientation, and direction of motion), less is known about how the brain learns and represents the meaning, or category, of stimuli. A greater understanding of visual categorization is critical for addressing a number of brain diseases and conditions (e.g. stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, and stroke) that leave patients impaired in everyday tasks that require visual learning, recognition and/or evaluating and responding appropriately to sensory information. The long-term goal of this project is to guide the next generation of treatments for these brain-based diseases and disorders by helping to develop a detailed understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie learning, memory and recognition. These studies also have relevance for understanding and addressing learning disabilities, such as attention deficit disorder and dyslexia, which affect a substantial fraction of school age children and young adults. Thus, a detailed understanding of the basic brain mechanisms of categorical decisions and attention will likely give important insights into the causes and potential treatments for disorders involving these cognitive and perceptual abilities.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3165,451,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R21AI172116-01A1,Discovery of a pigment produced by Streptococcus pyogenes,"Discovery of a pigment produced by Streptococcus pyogenes Abstract This proposal seeks to advance a new observation that the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) produces a pigment that has gone unreported. We hypothesize the pigment protects GAS from host-derived and/or environmental stressors (such as reactive oxygen species) and likely enhances its fitness and potentially augments its virulence. For 80 years, no reference in the literature exists of a pigment being produced by this important organism, and prior to that, only two citations allude to such a factor. We suspect this property has been overlooked because its presence only becomes apparent in the laboratory after culturing in a chemically defined medium, grown to high cell densities, and after exposure to oxygen. Understanding if and how the production of a pigment could boost the fitness of GAS could provide a new target that therapeutics or vaccines could take aim upon. The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the composition and structure of the GAS pigment, to identify genes associated with its production and regulation, and to characterize its ability to protect GAS from stressors and immune cell killing while exploring any cytotoxic properties.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,1270,195,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5UG1EY030410-05,Study of Latinos (SOL) Ojos,"This application proposes an ancillary eye study to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). HCHS/SOL is a prospective, population-based, multicenter cohort, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and 6 other National Institutes of Health (NIH) Institutes, that is designed to 1) assess disease burden; and, 2) address cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep disorders, dental caries and periodontal disease, hearing impairment, diabetes, kidney and liver disease, and cognitive impairment. This landmark study, the largest ever conducted in Hispanics/Latinos, constitutes a national resource of extensive, high-quality phenotypic and genotypic data. Participants include those of Mexican, Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Central and South American, and Other origins. HSHC/SOL recruited 16,415 participants for Visit #1 (2008-2011); data collection for Visit #2 (2014-2017) concluded 12/17 (Chicago and Miami Field Centers: 82.3% participation rate); and, NHLBI contracted HCHS/SOL Visit #3 (2019-2022) funding to serve as a platform for ancillary studies. We will recruit and perfom a detailed eye exam on 2500 HCHS/SOL participants from Chicago and Miami aged ≥40 years to coincide with Visit #3. The HCHS/SOL Coordinating Center will provide direction in oversampling older adults to maximize disease detection efficiency, with sampling weights reflecting probabilities of selection to maintain accurate prevalence rates. Latinos of diverse backgrounds as in HCHS/SOL represent a rich sociocultural and genetically admixed group, inheriting a mixture of European, Native American, and African ancestry from populations previously isolated. As such, the HCHS/SOL Eye Study will represent the first highly admixed eye epidemiology cohort. This heterogeneity and intrinsic variability, essential in basic and clinical research, innovatively positions the HCHS/SOL Eye Study to assess important etiologic pathways amid prevalent risk factors and outcomes that cannot be assessed with homogenous cohorts. We propose to collect high-quality eye outcome data, identical to National Eye Institute (NEI)-funded population-based cohorts, which will allow the eye epidemiology community to, for the first time, assess novel hypotheses associated with systemic disease in a well-characterized, diverse cohort. The HCHS/SOL Eye Study is designed to 1) assess and compare the 2010 age-standardized prevalence of chronic eye disease across Hispanic/Latino groups using previously constructed HCHS/SOL “genetic analysis groups” (Mainland: Mexicans, Central and South Americans; and, Caribbean: Cubans, Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans); and, 2) assess whether prevalent disease is associated with novel CVD, biomedical, and sociocultural risk factors.

5R01CA258833-03,Investigating Rational Combination Therapies for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to a collection of heterogeneous breast tumors that lack expression of immediately druggable molecules, such as the estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. No targeted therapy is currently approved for the vast majority of TNBC patients. TNBC patients who have received the current standard of care, consisting of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, often experience early tumor recurrence and a significantly worse mortality rate. Therefore, it is critical to identify and validate clinically viable, life-saving targeted therapies for patients with TNBC. We previously reported that the oncogenic MYC pathways were activated in ~50% of TNBC cases compared with non-TNBC cases and that MYC levels were associated with poor outcomes among TNBC patients. Unfortunately, clinical development of inhibitors that directly target MYC activity has remained challenging. To overcome this challenge, we previously took an alternative approach known as the synthetic lethal screening approach to identify readily druggable targets required for MYC-driven tumor viability but that are not essential in non-tumor cells. Our screen identified the PIM family of kinases, which is composed of the closely related nonessential kinase isoforms PIM1, -2, and -3 (PIM hereafter), as a promising target in MYC-driven TNBC. We found that PIM expression was elevated in triple-negative (TN) tumors in clinical samples and was associated with poor patient outcomes. Clinically relevant pan-PIM inhibitors showed activity in various experimental models of TNBC. However, our single-agent efficacy studies using preclinical PIM inhibitors showed that although PIM inhibition significantly slowed the growth of TN tumors, it induced only modest in vivo tumor cell death and regression, suggesting the need for combination therapies. We have taken robust drug screening approaches and have unexpectedly found that the drug combination that targets PIM kinases and the proteasome can acutely induce toxic levels of proteotoxic stress selectively in MYC-overexpressing TNBC cells. Mechanistically, our preliminary observations indicate that PIM inhibition, which elevates the levels of reactive oxygen species, when combined with proteasome inhibition, overwhelms the capacity of TNBC cells to continuously degrade damaged proteins, resulting in proteotoxic crisis. Thus, our observations raise the possibility—and our study will test the hypothesis—that PIM inhibition represents a unique and clinically viable tool to sensitize TNBC tumors to proteasome inhibition. The successful execution of this research will allow for the identification and interrogation of clinically exploitable vulnerabilities in MYC-driven solid-cancer types such as TNBC. The outcomes of this research could also encourage the FDA- approved proteasome inhibitors (e.g., carfilzomib), which have not been successfully used outside of liquid tumor types, to be rapidly evaluated in combination with pan-PIM kinase inhibitors in early-stage MYC-driven solid- tumor trials.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3108,436,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

However, more than half of PWH in the US do not receive regular HIV care, due largely to social and structural factors like stigma and discrimination, poverty, and care complexity, as well as conditions like mental health and substance abuse. Additional approaches to care delivery, especially for PWH experiencing compounding barriers, are needed to close the gap in sustained care and VS. Low-barrier care (LBC) is a package of implementation and care engagement strategies developed specifically to address barriers experienced by PWH with complex needs and has been shown to significantly improve VS among this population. The original model of standalone LBC clinics, however, may have challenges in scalability due to feasibility and limited reach to PWH within large areas. In contrast, adapting LBC strategies for integration into existing HIV primary care sites has the potential to facilitate greater use of this promising model of HIV care while also engaging more PWH with unaddressed needs. The overarching goal of this proposal is to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of adapted LBC strategies in a system of 12 HIV population-centered health homes (PCHHs) funded by the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) using a pragmatic trial design. Guided by the EPIS framework, we will achieve this goal through three specific aims: (1) Facilitate adoption, adaptation, and implementation of LBC strategies by PCHHs using a learning collaborative. Learning collaboratives are widely used, evidence-based implementation strategies. Following best practices, a lead facilitator and subject matter experts will help PCHHs explore and prepare protocols for implementation of LBC strategies while trained practice coaches will provide technical assistance around implementation at each site. CDPH has strong interest in integrating LBC strategies into PCHHs and will both mandate PCHH participation in the learning collaborative and encourage LBC implementation through additional funding. We will assess the process of adoption and implementation of LBC strategies using mixed methods. (2) Evaluate site-specific and system-wide effectiveness of integrated LBC strategies at improving sustained care and VS. Using a single-arm, pre–post trial design, we will assess if rates of retention in care and VS improve in the two years following ramp-up of LBC strategies. We will also examine contextual factors and implementation fidelity using mixed methods to explain variability in outcomes across PCHHs. (3) Assess implementation cost and sustainment of LBC strategies among PCHHs. We will examine implementation costs over time and plans for sustainment using mixed methods. Our proposal directly responds to RFA-AI-21-024 and is consistent with the NIH Office of AIDS Research’s high priority of implementation science to improve HIV service delivery and reduce disparities in treatment. Results from this study will facilitate the use of LBC strategies in new settings to reach PWH with complex needs.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3175,475,1.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DC015426-09,Principles of olfactory reward processing in the human brain,"PROJECT SUMMARY A crucial function of the central nervous system is to bias behavior toward events and outcomes that hold relevance for survival. It is well recognized that odors have a strong effect on animal behavior, as they guide food search, maternal bonding, and mate selection. Even though humans do not consider olfaction to be a dominant sense, humans are similarly swayed by the rewarding properties of odors. With recent developments in the pattern-based analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, we are now in a position to explore the neural mechanisms of olfactory reward in humans. During the previous funding cycle, we gained key insights into how odor rewards are represented in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and how the dopaminergic midbrain may support these representations. The objective of the current renewal application is to capitalize on these novel methods in order to address new questions arising from these initial findings about the neural mechanisms of odor-guided behavior in humans. Specifically, we will use OFC-targeted transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and novel behavioral tasks that involve food odors as rewards to reveal the specific contribution of different OFC networks to decision making. Moreover, the proposed studies will combine network-based TMS with pattern-based fMRI to elucidate the neural mechanisms that drive learning about the identity of future odor rewards. Complementary studies will examine how one’s motivational state modulates perceptional and neural responses to food odors, such that they can aid the detection of biologically relevant rewards in the environment. Together the experiments proposed in this project will fundamentally extend our understanding of olfactory reward processing in the human brain at the functional and mechanistic level, with implications for neuroscientific research on learning, memory, and behavior in general. Moreover, the findings from this work can lead to a better understanding of the behavioral deficits described in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Schizophrenia, eating disorders, and addiction, and may ultimately provide insights into the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2296,333,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01GM131421-06,Continuous Probing of Nanoconstruct-Cell Interactions at Biologically Relevant Time Scales,"PROJECT SUMMARY This renewal application builds on our discovery that the shape of nanoparticle-based constructs—what we define as structural valency—plays a key role in preserving the targeting ligand characteristics of nanoconstructs even when coated by a protein corona. Protein corona formation and its impact on engineered physicochemical properties of nanoconstructs has been somewhat controversial but is generally accepted to affect cell and tissue targeting specificity and downstream biological effects. Using single-particle, live-cell imaging investigations, we found that the protein corona composition of an ensemble of nanoconstructs was superseded by single-particle shape effects. Compared to their spherical counterparts, nanoconstructs with branched structures retained their ligand shell targeting capabilities both on cell membranes and within cells and cellular compartments. Statistically significant differences in the time-resolved dynamics of differently shaped nanoconstructs interacting with cellular components cannot be attributed to very minimal variations in protein corona composition. We aim to determine the mechanism for how branched nanoconstructs maintain their targeting functionality in biological environments and then to modulate the spatial organization of the single-particle protein corona with light during live-cell interactions. We will tune the nanoscale features of the branched nanoconstructs, including overall size, branch length, and tip radii of curvature, to be commensurate with membrane receptor dimerization and curvature-induced endosomal signaling and will image interactions at the single-particle level. The specific aims include (1) Understand how nanoconstruct design and optical stimuli can manipulate the protein corona at the single-particle level; (2) Investigate structural multivalency of membrane-targeting branched nanoconstructs on receptor dimerization; (3) Improve intracellular targeting and delivery using branched nanoconstruct shapes. This work is expected to be of high impact for precision nanomedicine by the intersection of single-nanoparticle advances with mechanistic insight into biological responses. Our ability to resolve nanoparticle-cell interactions at relevant time and length scales for receptor recognition and internalization will benefit knowledge in protein dimerization and nanoscale curvature effects and deepen understanding of endocytosis and immunomodulatory responses—key processes for advancements in vaccine design and drug delivery.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2540,326,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5D43CA260658-04,Infection-Associated Cancer Research Training Program in Mali,"PROJECT SUMMARY The Northwestern University (NU) and Mali’s University of Sciences, Techniques, and Technologies of Bamako (USTTB)’s Infection-Associated Cancer (NM-IAC) Research Training Program addresses a National Cancer Institute (NCI) high research priority and a significant and growing source of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Mali. In 2018, the four most common infection-associated cancers (IACs; cervical, liver, gastric and lung cancers) represented more than a quarter (27%) of all registered cancers in Mali. The NM-IAC Program seeks to build an interdisciplinary, collaborative, research training program to train researchers in the conduct of population-based cancer epidemiology and molecular studies and advance the discovery of unique population-specific risk factors and biomarkers for the development of risk stratification and screening tools of individuals with underlying infections at increased risk of associated cancers, with the ultimate goal of improving detection, treatment, and outcomes. The NM-IAC Program will leverage our team’s extensive experience in conducting NIH-funded global health research training programs in Africa, program refinements, and highly successful training resources and outcomes from our decade-long, research-training collaboration between USTTB and NU. Our central hypothesis is that building capacity in the key disciplines involved in IACs will empower Malian and US investigators to develop and implement novel, contextually appropriate, and culturally adapted risk stratification and screening tools. To achieve our goals, our specific aims are to (1) Train two (2) PhD-level cancer epidemiologists, each with a focus on one of the four IACs and capable of (i) designing and conducting population-based cancer epidemiology studies; (ii) developing protocols for biospecimen collection, processing, and storage; and (iii) evaluating population-specific biomarkers for use in screening and identifying “at-risk” populations; and Two master’s-level molecular pathologists, one biostatistician, and one bio-informatician, capable of (i) collecting and managing clinical, laboratory, and population-level specimens and data; (ii) using virtual modalities for training, education, and mentoring and telepathology for distance microscopic diagnostics and training; and (iii) performing comprehensive biostatistical and bioinformatics analyses, generated from population-level studies; (2) Enhance the knowledge and skills of existing faculty, particularly early career faculty, to contribute to and participate in interdisciplinary research teams of mechanistic and population-based studies of IACs through medium-term intensive workshops and mentored research projects led by the scientists trained in Aim 1; and (3) Optimize engagement of public health scientists, clinicians, and health system stakeholders through workshops and seminars to disseminate knowledge about the novel epidemiological and biomarker tools and strategies, for use in new programs focused on the prevention and detection of IACs in Mali.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3102,413,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01AI168016-02,Determinants of oral anaphylaxis to food,"PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this proposal is to identify new ways of preventing anaphylaxis in those with food allergy by defining cellular and molecular mechanisms that transport intact food allergens across the gut epithelium. In its most severe form, food allergy can trigger life-threatening anaphylaxis. One factor that can determine risk of anaphylaxis is the integrity of the gut barrier, but there are no treatments to reduce intestinal permeability to food allergens. A major mode of allergen transport across the gut epithelium occurs transcellularly through secretory and goblet cell-associated antigen passages (GAPs). Using mouse models of peanut and egg allergy, we have made the exciting discovery that susceptibility to oral anaphylaxis was genetically determined and associated with an increased number and function of GAPs. Using a forward genetic screen we identified a single chromosomal region that tracks with this phenotype. Moreover, drug treatments targeting goblet cell biology reduced anaphylaxis in vivo. We hypothesize that the genetic regulation of gut goblet cell quantity and transport capability determines susceptibility to anaphylaxis by controlling intestinal permeability to intact food allergens. In Aim 1, using complementary mouse strains described above, we will perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with SNP genotyping to identify genetic resistance loci for oral anaphylaxis associated with reduced gut permeability. These data will be integrated with scRNA-Seq analyses of intestinal epithelium from anaphylaxis susceptible vs. resistant littermates to identify cell type-specific regulators of allergen transport. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in mice, we will test the contribution to gut permeability and oral anaphylaxis in vivo of known and novel candidate genes. In Aim 2 we will determine goblet cell-intrinsic vs. goblet cell extrinsic pathways that inhibit allergen transport. Our preliminary data in mice suggests that the number and function of GAPs prominently contribute to susceptibility to oral anaphylaxis. Using bone marrow chimeras and in vitro human or mouse enteroid cultures we will directly test whether transcellular transport of allergens is increased in anaphylaxis susceptible humans or mice and will determine whether these phenotypes are epithelial cell-intrinsic or -extrinsic. In Aim 3 we will perform a targeted screen of FDA approved drugs that could inhibit goblet cell differentiation and/or function for their ability to block fluorescent allergen uptake in vitro and oral anaphylaxis in vivo. Effective compounds will be validated using human gut enteroids from donors with or without food allergy. We have already identified multiple drugs that reduce allergen transport in oral anaphylaxis susceptible mice, highlighting that pharmaceutical blockade of these pathways could potentially prevent anaphylaxis in patients with food allergy. Impact: Identifying genes and cellular pathways regulating food allergen transport by gut epithelia could lead to new ways of preventing anaphylaxis and to diagnostic approaches to more accurately stratify anaphylaxis risk for food-allergic individuals.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3183,455,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01EY034662-02,Genetic Underpinnings of ipRGC Diversity,"PROJECT SUMMARY Light is a profoundly important regulator of physiology and behavior across a wide range of organisms. Light information is relayed via diverse retinal ganglion cell types to approximately 50 distinct targets in the brain. The melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) represent 6 of the ~40-50 retinal ganglion cell types present in the mouse retina. M1-M6 ipRGCs are defined by a distinct complement of subtype-defining morphological, physiological, and transcriptional characteristics. However, how this cellular diversity is achieved is largely unknown. This proposal will investigate the molecular underpinnings of ipRGC diversity. ipRGCs also represent an excellent microcosm for studying diversity in the larger RGC population because 1) ipRGCs can be specifically manipulated with multiple, existing genetic tools, 2) transcriptional profiling has revealed gene expression programs that designate ipRGC subtypes, and 3) the diversity of ipRGC subtype morphology, physiology, central projections, and roles in behavior are a broad, and representative subsample of subtype-defining features of RGCs. Thus, ipRGCs are an approachable, representative, and genetically malleable population in which to study cellular diversity. In the experiments outlined below, we will exploit the advantages of the ipRGC system by combining targeted, single cell measurements of ipRGC morphology and physiology with powerful, large-scale transcriptomic approaches in new genetic models to assess how the full range of ipRGC subtypes are established. Brn3b (Pouf42) is a transcription factor involved in RGC specification, and its expression is maintained in ipRGC subtypes into adult stages, where it is poised to influence developmental and adult gene expression programs that give rise to the subtype-defining properties of ipRGCs. This proposal will test the hypothesis that Brn3b actively shapes the morphological, physiological, and transcriptional identity of ipRGC subtypes. In Aim 1 we will use new mouse lines to manipulate Brn3b expression in ipRGCs during development and adulthood to determine the consequences of increasing or reducing Brn3b levels on the morphophysiological features of ipRGCs. In Aim 2 we will determine the roles of Brn3b in shaping gene expression patterns across retinal development and within individual ipRGC subtypes. Excitingly, our preliminary data indicate that Brn3b expression levels in ipRGC subtypes not only correlate with multiple ipRGC features, but also actively regulate defining features of ipRGC subtypes, suggesting that Brn3b is repurposed throughout development and adulthood to fine-tune ipRGC circuit structure and function. These studies will generate a blueprint for understanding how the patterning of transcriptional programs establishes diverse cellular identities in the retina and nervous system.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2907,405,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5U01DK123759-05,Glycemic Profile of Pregnancy Consortium Biostatistics Research Center,"PROJECT SUMMARY Maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy is a known risk factor for high birthweight, excessive newborn adiposity, and related pregnancy complications including cesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia and birth injury. Sequelae of elevated pregnancy glucose are not limited to the perinatal period. Mothers meeting criteria for gestational diabetes are more likely to develop long-term metabolic disorders including Type 2 diabetes. Maternal glucose also has an apparent sustained influence on fetal programming, with offspring of hyperglycemic mothers at higher risk of both excess adiposity and disordered glucose metabolism throughout childhood and into adolescence. While debate exists as to specific criteria that should be used for diagnosing gestational diabetes, it is the case that adverse maternal and offspring outcomes related to both anthropometrics and glucose metabolism, both at delivery and over a decade later, are associated with maternal glucose values across the continuum. Existing diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes are based on measures of maternal glucose, typically at ~28 weeks' gestation. To more fully elucidate maternal glycemia and identify potential early indicators of gestational diabetes, Clinical Centers comprising the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' Glycemic Profile of Pregnancy Consortium will be charged with designing a multicenter observational study of pregnant mothers without pre-existing diabetes to richly characterize maternal glycemic profiles using sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring technology. The Northwestern University Biostatistics Research Center proposes to serve as a central leadership hub for the Glycemic Profile of Pregnancy Consortium, coordinating all data-related and operational activities using cutting-edge resources for study design, planning and conduct, ongoing data monitoring and statistical analysis.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,1940,259,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R56MH135860-01,NKCC1-KCC2 system modulation in rodent models relevant for psychiatric disorders,"Summary Excitation/inhibition imbalance is considered a major factor leading to cognitive impairment and social interaction deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia), yet the cellular mechanisms underlying this imbalance are not fully established. Using subchronic phencyclidine (scPCP)-treated mice, a pharmacological model of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, we discovered that GABAA function shifts from inhibitory to excitatory in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex of scPCP mice. We further found that this shift is caused by the selective enhancement of the expression of the chloride transporter NKCC1, and that NKCC1 antagonism using the NKKC1 inhibitor bumetanide completely restores the GABAA current reversal potential to the control values. Importantly, we also showed that in-vivo treatment with bumetanide (IP or local cortical infusion) rescues cognitive performance in scPCP mice. Our preliminary data further validate these results, showing that bumetanide rescues cognitive performance in male 16p11.2 duplication mice, a genetic model relevant for schizophrenia. We hypothesize that depolarizing GABAA signaling in the mPFC represents a convergent pathogenic mechanism causing impaired cognition across multiple genetic models relevant to schizophrenia and that bumetanide treatment may be effective across all these models. To test this hypothesis, we will take advantage of three etiologically different genetic mouse models reflecting variable genetic risk for schizophrenia: a copy number variant model (16p11.2 duplication), a rare variants model (TRIO+/-), and a common variant model (Cacna1C+/-). These models were developed to mimic genetic conditions known to significantly increase the incidence of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia in humans and show numerous deficits in PFC-specific cognitive tasks such as working memory and reversal learning. In Aim 1 we will use perforated patch recordings in acute cortical slices to determine the reversal potential of the GABAA current in pyramidal cells of the mPFC, and quantitative in situ hybridization to quantify expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 transcripts in mPFC from male and female mice. In Aim 2 we will use behavioral assessment of wild-type mice in which mPFC NKCC1/KCC2 is increased using pharmacologic or genetic tools to test the hypothesis that increased mPFC NKCC1/KCC2 is a condition sufficient to cause cognitive impairment, even in the absence of other cellular dysfunctions. We will also the effects of this manipulation on mPFC gene expression and morphology. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the behavioral effects of NKCC1 inhibition in our three disease models. We will test the effects of acute and chronic treatment with bumetanide, as well as of selective genetic alteration of the NKCC1/KCC2 ratio in the mPFC of these mice, on several cognitive tests. We will also test the alternative hypothesis that bumetanide acts on glia rather than neuronal cells. Successful completion of our experiments may have important translational relevance as bumetanide is an FDA-approved drug and thus could be immediately tested in clinical trials.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3202,461,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R01NS136123-01,Investigation of Pallidal Neurons in Motor Inhibition,"Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of how the external globus pallidus (GPe) within the basal ganglia controls movement and how it goes awry in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite compelling evidence that the GPe plays a critical role in regulating motor activity, its neuronal composition has been poorly defined. As the neurons that encompass the GPe are heterogeneous, understanding how the activity of the GPe is regulated in behavioral and disease contexts has posed a challenge. Through a series of investigations during the last funding cycle, we surveyed the molecular landscape of the mouse GPe. By characterizing a number of driver and reporter lines, we have now established a near-complete neuron taxonomy of the GPe. Using the newly available genetic tools in conjunction with cell- and circuit-specific approaches, we began to understand how GPe neuron subtypes control full-body movements. In this application, we will examine the activity dynamics of GPe neuron subtypes and their regulation of their synaptic partners to clarify the mechanisms involved. These experiments will provide new information about how motor inhibition is produced by the GPe and the basal ganglia as a whole. Using a well-established chronic model of PD, we will provide unprecedented insights into how alterations in these processes underlie hypokinetic symptoms of PD. The yielded knowledge will not only inform the processes underlying motor (dys)function but will also help develop circuit interventions that target the hypokinetic symptoms of PD.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,1589,242,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

7R01DK124132-05,STING signaling in T cells regulation of intestinal homeostasis and inflammatorybowel diseases,"STING (stimulator of interferon genes), a cytoplasmic sensor for cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), plays a crucial role as an adaptor molecule for a number of intracellular DNA receptors. The upstream DNA sensors that signal through STING include cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), IFN-inducible proteins, and DExD/H-box helicase family proteins, highlighting an important function for STING in controlling multiple DNA recognition pathways. STING has been crucial in host defense against viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens, and also to the development of autoimmune disease. Abnormalities in this defense mechanism can underpin a spectrum of conditions, including cancer and autoinflammatory diseases. STING is thus a highly promising drug target. Recent studies have underscored the role of STING in regulating intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis. As high levels of microbiota-derived DNA and CDNs are present in the gut, these stimuli could contribute to local activation of STING at steady state. Sting-/- mice have been reported to develop more severe colitis upon acute inflammatory insult. Our preliminary data demonstrated that T cells expressed STING at levels higher than that in dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, activation of STING signaling promoted T cell production of IL-10 and IL- 22 but inhibited IL-17 production, indicating that STING may potentially regulate intestinal homeostasis and colitis development by promoting anti-inflammatory IL-10/IL-22 and inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production by T cells. In this application, we will test whether STING promotes T cell production of IL-10 and IL-22 by inducing IRF4 and AHR expression mediated by the production of type I IFNs by both T cells and dendritic cells, which would lead to the preservation of intestinal immune homeostasis and inhibition of IBD.

1R01AG078261-01A1,Delirium Dynamics: Understanding Causes and Effects,"Project Summary / Abstract Delirium is an acute disturbance of attention and awareness that afflicts >20% of hospitalized older adults and costs up to $152 billion each year due to associations with prolonged hospitalization, cognitive decline, and an accelerated course of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Delirium is especially challenging to evaluate and treat because it is dynamic: patients fluctuate between severe symptoms one hour to minimal the next, exposing a knowledge gap: we do not know which factors mediate those fluctuations. Many delirium risk factors, such as age, are irreversible and do not explain delirium’s dynamic course. In contrast, sleep-wake activity and circadian rhythms are highly dynamic and potentially modifiable. While the incidences of sleep disturbance and delirium are generally associated, whether and how they interact remains unclear, and clinical trials targeting sleep do not consistently improve delirium. There is a critical need to determine the sequence of events through which specific disturbances of sleep-wake activity impact delirium’s trajectory. These efforts have been limited by a lack of tools to measure delirium and sleep-wake activity continuously. The long-term goal of this project is to identify new delirium treatments by understanding the characteristics, causes, and effects of delirium fluctuations. The current objective is to apply novel continuous monitoring to test the central hypothesis that specific sleep-wake and circadian features predict acute delirium fluctuations, which in turn forecast long-term cognitive decline. The rationale for the proposed work is that continuous monitoring of delirium and sleep-wake activity will identify specific disturbances in sleep-wake and circadian activity that impact delirium’s trajectory, sharpening focus on those specific disturbances to manage delirium acutely. This project utilizes an innovative approach that integrates recently developed measures of physiologic delirium severity, sleep-wake activity, and circadian rhythms with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to quantify the course of delirium rigorously. These measures will be used to study the acute course and long-term trajectory of delirium in 400 hospitalized, non-intubated adults aged 65 years or older, admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, one of the most common causes of delirium in older adults. Aim 1 will establish the temporal characteristics of delirium using EEG in hospitalized older adults. Aim 2 will determine which features of sleep- wake activity affect the subsequent course of delirium. Aim 3 will identify the features of acute delirium trajectories that predict long-term cognitive impairment. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to the following expected outcomes: (1) new methods to quantify and track delirium severity at the bedside, (2) identification of specific sleep, circadian biology, and environmental factors as therapeutic targets to improve delirium, and (3) improved ability to identify patients with elevated risk of poor cognitive outcome during the therapeutic window. These outcomes will establish a firm physiologic foundation, objective biomarkers, and critical targets to understand and ameliorate delirium’s acute and long-term impacts.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3300,469,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01NS117608-02,Precise Prediction and Treatment of Seizures After Intracranial Hemorrhage,"PROJECT SUMMARY Seizures are a common and morbid complication of intracranial hemorrhage, leading to brain herniation, worse patient outcome, and death. While a few risk factors for seizures have been described, the ability to predict seizures is still crude. The inaccuracy of seizure prediction leads to imprecise administration of prophylactic antiseizure medications. Prophylactic antiseizure medications are intended to prevent seizures, reduce complications, and improve patient outcomes. Unfortunately, antiseizure medications have been independently associated with more complications, worse patient outcomes, and worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL), particularly cognitive function HRQoL. Better methods are needed to predict precisely which patients are likely to have seizures after intracranial hemorrhage to prevent them, and, further, to determine which patients are likely to benefit from prophylactic antiseizure medications. We will continue a successful line of research. At the time we began to study this topic, prophylactic phenytoin was recommended by guidelines. After publications implicated phenytoin with more complications and worse patient outcomes, guidelines were changed to discourage the use of prophylactic phenytoin, and clinicians broadly switched from phenytoin to levetiracetam. We recently reported that prophylactic levetiracetam is independently associated with worse cognitive function HRQoL in the 40% of patients who receive it, underscoring that current practice may lead to inadvertent harm, an untenable status quo. The effects of seizures on HRQoL are worse than prophylactic antiseizure medication. Preventing seizures by precise administration of prophylactic antiseizure medication would be helpful. This proposal has two major aims that will improve patient outcomes after intracranial hemorrhage. First, we will build upon our previous work to derive and validate a multi-dimensional model for predicting seizures after intracranial hemorrhage from electroencephalography and imaging data to identify the patients most likely to benefit from prophylactic seizure medication. A prospective database with recording of seizures and patient outcomes provides preliminary data. Future data will be electronically abstracted from a health care system with a single electronic health record using automated techniques from electroencephalography reports, raw electroencephalography data, and neuroimaging source data. Then, we will determine the effect of prophylactic seizure medication on patient HRQoL at high risk for seizures, and use other machine learning techniques to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from prophylactic antiseizure medication. At the conclusion of this proposal, we will deliver a model to predict patients most likely to have seizures, and determine which patients are likely to have higher HRQoL as a results of prophylactic seizure medications, leading to targeted treatment and non-treatment to maximize patient HRQoL.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3020,413,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01AR081103-03,Investigate MOF regulated epigenetic mechanisms of skin development,"Project Summary Epigenetic mechanisms, in particular the ones mediated by Histone modifications, have emerged as an essential layer of gene expression control mechanism. In the skin, several Histone modifications such as H3K27me3 and Histone deacetylase such as HDAC1/2/3 have been studied. These elegant studies have not only provided novel insights into important functions of epigenetic mechanisms in the skin but also established skin as an excellent model system to study epigenetic mechanisms in a spatiotemporally well- defined tissue. However, our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in the skin is incomplete. The functions of numerous Histone marks and their associated modifying enzymes are unknown. Among them, Histone 4 Lysine16 acetylation (H4K16Ac) is particularly notable for its key role in regulating chromatin compaction. Structural and biophysical studies indicate that H4K16Ac plays an essential role in transcription activation by influencing both nucleosome structure and interaction with chromatin-binding proteins. H4K16Ac is catalyzed by the MYST-family lysine acetyltransferase MOF (also known as KAT8), which is broadly conserved in fly, mouse and human. The function of MOF and its catalyzed H4K16Ac mark is first studied in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where H4K16Ac mark is found to coat the male X- chromosome and elevate transcription by two-fold tomediate sex dosage compensation. However, the function of MOF and H4K16Ac is not limited to X-chromosome genes for dosage compensation. MOF and H4K16Ac have been shown to control many genes involved in the regulation of embryonic stem cells, liver development, pericyte development among many others in mouse and human. The overarching goal of this application is to determine the role of MOF and H4K16Ac mediated transcriptional control in epidermal development. During our preliminary study, we have discovered that genetic deletion of MOF causes severe defects in epidermal adhesion, differentiation and morphogenesis. In thisapplication, we will elucidate molecular mechanisms and cellular functions of MOF/H4K16Ac during epidermal development. We propose to 1) investigate the role of MOF in epidermal development; 2) Determine the mechanism of MOF in governing ciliogenesis and mitochondrial functions; and 3) Elucidate the epigenetic mechanism of MOF- mediated gene expression control. Combining our expertise in mouse genetics, transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, epithelial biology, genomics and computational biology, we will provide genetic, genomic and molecular insights into a critical epigenetic mechanism governing mammalian skin development.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2660,375,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01NS067550-10,ZFP24 Control of the myelination program of oligodendrocytes,"The zinc finger protein 24 (ZFP24) is required for oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination. ZFP24 binds to a consensus DNA sequence in proximity to genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation, and this binding enhances target gene expression. ZFP24 contains four C2H2 zinc-finger domains that are interspersed by three conserved linkers. ZFP24 DNA binding is controlled by phosphorylation of the conserved linkers: phosphorylated ZFP24, which does not bind DNA, is the predominant form in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). As these cells mature into oligodendrocytes, the non-phosphorylated, DNA-binding form accumulates. Our findings indicate that changes to ZFP24 phosphorylation control its binding to regulatory regions of genes important for oligodendrocyte maturation, controls their expression, and thereby regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination. Therefore, it is critical to identify the kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) responsible for controlling the functional status of ZFP24. In the first aim we propose two distinct unbiased screening approaches toward the identification of the ZFP24 kinase(s). We will also examine the effect of inhibition of the identified kinase(s) on ZFP24 phosphorylation, ZFP24 activity, oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin related gene expression. The second aim focuses on identifying the phosphatase(s) that de-phosphorylates ZFP24 to generate the functional transcriptional factor. We will use a candidate phosphatase screen, as well as an unbiased screen to identify these ZFP24 phosphatases. We will also examine the effect of inhibition of the identified phosphatase(s) on ZFP24 activity, ZFP24 phosphorylation, oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin related gene expression. In the third aim we will characterize phosphorylation intermediate isoforms of ZFP24. We have identified ZFP24 isoforms in which one, two or all three potential phosphorylation sites in the conserved ZFP24 linker domains are phosphorylated in cultured oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Currently it is unclear whether these are non-functional, transitional ZFP24 isoforms, or if these forms are important intermediates with unique functions in oligodendrocyte development. Therefore, in the third aim we will study the half-life of the intermediate forms and determine if the distinct isoforms have unique functions in oligodendrocyte development. Aim four is devoted to the elucidation of the potential role that ZFP24 plays in the CNS of adult animals, including myelin maintenance and remyelination. We also propose to generate a new mouse model that will allow for the inducible expression of the active, non- phosphorylated, form of ZFP24 in OPCs. This model will be used to test the potential ability of the active form of ZFP24 to enhance remyelination. Overall, the studies described here will provide a more detailed understanding of the role that ZFP24 phosphorylation plays in oligodendrocyte maturation, CNS myelination, and remyelination. This understanding may allow for the therapeutic modulation of ZFP24 activity to enhance the myelinating and remyelinating potential of OPCs.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3153,442,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R01DC020962-01A1,Next Generation OAEs,"Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) are grossly underutilized in clinical applications. Yet the need for early and accurate diagnosis as well as monitoring of new therapies is growing and will demand more precise diagnostic tools. This proposal lays the foundation for assimilating advanced DPOAE diagnostics into clinical practice. Specifically, the first aim will validate the test performance of a new protocol for recording DP-Grams. This protocol will use frequency-specific stimulus conditions that are matched to local properties of the cochlea with the goal of better detection of mild-to-moderate hearing loss. The second aim will utilize DPOAE growth functions to detect early changes in the cochlea due to aging and differentiate these effects from those induced by over-exposure to noise. The third aim will use an innovative expansion of DPOAEs to objectively estimate cochlear tuning. The proposal will create a two-dimensional joint metric of tuning and DPOAE strength, which will help to identify hearing-related declines beyond mere changes in sensitivity. The proposed work also serves the critical need to extend the frequency bandwidth of all DPOAE applications to the highest frequencies of human hearing. This is made possible by incorporating modern calibration and signal delivery/recording techniques – developed in part by the laboratories of both PIs – into all experiments. The proposed experiments are built on previous peer-reviewed and published work from the two participating laboratories. Taken together, the proposed experiments are critical next steps necessary to move DPOAEs from a screening tool to potent clinical probe that serves the next generation of diagnostic and monitoring needs.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,1740,256,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5U01DK137258-02,Improving access to renal transplantation for Underserved Black Communities,"Project Summary While Black persons account for approximately 14.6% of the US population, among those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 35% are Black. Treatment options include dialysis, but best outcomes (survival, quality of life, cost) are achieved with kidney transplantation. Yet, Black ESRD patients are less likely referred for kidney transplant evaluation - a national mandate for those with ESRD - less likely listed for kidney transplantation, less likely to receive a kidney transplantation. As outlined by the FOA (RFA-DK-22-014), structural racism is a fundamental cause of the stark racial disparity in health outcomes for Black patients with ESRD in the US. Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the US and serves as an excellent example of structurally racist communities that have disinvested in Black communities with a mean life-expectancy that is almost 30 years lower than that of affluent predominantly White Chicago neighborhoods. To counteract these severe forces of structural racism, Dr. Simpson, engaged with the Black community to build and name the first and largest African American Transplant Access Program {AATAP) in the nation and has enjoyed national prominence. AATAP is a multi-pronged intervention with 4 pillars: 1. Cultural Congruency, 2. Trust/Activation, 3. Health Literacy, and 4. Psychosocial Support taking a 'Keeping it RE.A.LL.'

1R01NR021291-01,Implementing A Secure Firearm Storage Program in Illinois Health Centers in Partnership with AllianceChicago and the Illinois Primary Health Care Association,"Firearms are now the leading cause of death for young people in the United States, with stark inequities for young people from minoritized communities (e.g., race, ethnicity, LGTBQ+ populations). Secure firearm storage programs are evidence-based, low-cost, scalable, and non-politically divisive. Current efforts to implement these programs primarily occur in ambulatory and acute care settings in largely well-resourced health systems. There is a need to study adaptation and implementation of these programs in community settings including federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and look-alike safety net health centers. These community settings currently serve 1 in 11 people seeking health care in the United States and prioritize offering services to all areas and populations, thus making them critical partners for efforts to promote equitable delivery to all populations. In 2023, our team completed the largest hybrid effectiveness-implementation type III trial of its kind (R01 MH123491; “ASPIRE”), in which ~45,000 pediatric well-visits in 30 clinics in two large health systems were eligible to receive S.A.F.E. Firearm, an evidence-based, universal secure firearm storage program that includes a brief conversation between a clinician and parent about secure firearm storage and offering free cable locks. Prior to implementation, clinicians delivered these program components in 3% of well-visits. After clinics and clinicians received training, clinical decision support in the electronic health record, and facilitation, clinicians delivered these program components in 41% of well-visits, representing robust practice change that can save lives. In the proposed study, “COMMUNITY-ASPIRE,” we partner with AllianceChicago, a national practice- based research network, and the Illinois Primary Health Care Association, the state-wide organization for FQHCs, to study the adaptation and implementation of S.A.F.E. Firearm in Illinois FQHCs. In Aim 1, in collaboration with key partners (e.g., clinicians, leaders, parents), we will adapt and optimize S.A.F.E. Firearm and our implementation approach for FQHCs. In Aim 2, we will conduct a pragmatic hybrid type III stepped wedge effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial with 12 FQHCs and 720 participants across Illinois to test the effectiveness of our adapted implementation approach (training and facilitation emphasizing equitable S.A.F.E. Firearm delivery) on parent-reported receipt of S.A.F.E. Firearm (i.e., reach; primary implementation outcome). We will also assess secondary implementation outcomes (stage of implementation, cost, acceptability) and effectiveness outcomes (parent firearm storage behavior). In Aim 3, we will use mixed methods to identify mechanisms. First, we will conduct interviews to understand constituent perspectives on implementation mechanisms and equitable intervention receipt. Second, we will evaluate reach and firearm storage behavior by demographic characteristics and social determinants of health. Results will guide future implementation of secure firearm storage programs in FQHCs and prioritize scalability, generalizability, and equity.

5F31CA268839-02,Elucidating transcriptional and epigenetic regulators of aggressive cutaneous T cell lymphoma,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is an incurable non-Hodgkin lymphoma of skin homing T cells. Clinical outcomes of CTCL are highly heterogenous with some patients surviving <6 months and others >10 years in stage matched patients with advanced disease. The molecular mechanisms that drive heterogeneity of disease outcomes remain poorly understood. We have employed whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and functional assays in a large cohort of primary patient samples to understand the genetic basis of CTCLs. We have identified deletion of PDCD1, a gene encoding the co-inhibitory receptor PD1, as a monogenic driver of CTCL disease aggression and phenotypes. Analysis of CTCLs in a multi-institutional cohort showed that PD1 deletion predicts a significantly worse overall survival in patients. This is recapitulated in our functional assays with primary patient samples where CTCLs with PD1 deletion displayed increased proliferation ex vivo. Notably, PD1 expressing CTCLs had increased expression of co-inhibitory receptors and gene signatures of T cell exhaustion, a dysfunctional state in T cells that limits effector functions. Interestingly, PD1 appears to drive a durable exhaustion phenotype that is retained by cells ex vivo even in the absence of ligand, suggesting that exhausted CTCLs have an epigenetic tumor suppressor program that is lost in PD1 deleted CTCLs. In addition, our preliminary RNA-seq data identified 60 transcription factors differentially expressed between PD1 expressing and deleted cohorts of CTCL, many but not all have been implicated in T cell exhaustion from studies with tumor models. Therefore, in this proposal, we aim to mechanistically dissect the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of aggressive phenotypes in PD1-deleted CTCL samples. In Aim 1, we will identify whether transcription factors upregulated in PD1 expressing CTCLs are necessary or sufficient for in promoting CTCL exhaustion. In addition, we will also utilize primary patient samples to determine if the reversal of downregulation/upregulation of transcription factors in each CTCL cohort can reverse or increase exhaustion phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the PD1 dependent epigenetic regulators in primary CTCLs We will combine epigenetic and transcriptomic data to identify differentially expressed transcription factors in each CTCL cohort in an unbiased way. My overall career goal is to become a successful, independent research scientist. The rigorous training plan proposed in this fellowship will allow me to achieve that goal by gaining research skills and knowledge in cellular immunology, cancer signaling pathways, and epigenetics.

5R01HL158963-03,Combining longitudinal cohort studies to examine cardiovascular risk factor trajectories across the adult lifespan and their association with disease,"The development of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a process that occurs across the lifespan, beginning early in life and spanning late into life as clinical event rates increase. Much of our understanding of the impact of cardiovascular risk factors comes from studies examining the association between risk factor levels measured at a single point in time, often in middle age, with incident disease over the short- to intermediate-term. However, risk factor levels in young adulthood are signiﬁcantly associated with the development of CVD later in life and our recent work has demonstrated that not only the levels at speciﬁc ages, but also cumulative exposures and long-term trajectories in cardiovascular health are signiﬁcantly related to the risk for subsequent CVD. Therefore, a life course approach is critical in order to understand how cardiovascular risk factors develop and impact an individual's risk for CVD events later in life. Yet there is no single study that has collected detailed phenotypic data spanning young adulthood through old age on a broadly representative sample of the U.S. population. In response to NOT-HL-19-712: Innovative Data Evaluation and Analysis to Health, we propose to de- velop a statistical framework for combining longitudinal risk factors and clinical outcomes data from multiple cohort studies to create a “synthetic cohort” enabling the study of long-term cardiovascular health starting in early adulthood. The investigative team of this proposal has pooled the data from 20 community-based CVD cohorts through the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project (LRPP), which now has >11 million person-years of follow- up data on repeated measures of CVD risk factors, detailed information about medication use (including blood pressure- and cholesterol-lowering therapy), nearly 100% follow-up for vital status, and detailed CVD event adju- dication. Few cohorts in the LRPP cover the entire adult lifespan; therefore, we propose to view risk factors and outcomes at ages not included in each cohort study as missing data, and to use multiple imputation to ﬁll in these unobserved measurements to facilitate analysis. The overall goal of this project is to identify and measure the characteristics of CVD risk factor trajectories across the adult lifespan that are most amenable to intervention. Measuring these characteristics can help identify critical periods for intervention, more precisely deﬁne thresholds for known risk factors, elucidate the role of lifestyle behaviors, explain differences in health among populations, and promote CVD prevention strategies at younger ages. Our speciﬁc aims are: 1) Develop and validate a statistical framework for imputing unobserved CVD risk factors and events across the lifespan using data from the LRPP; 2) Inform treatment strategies by identifying clinically relevant features of longitudi- nal risk factor trajectories that are associated with CVD outcomes; 3) Leverage the work from Aims 1 and 2 to facilitate the dissemination and use of the synthetic LRPP data by the research community.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3086,466,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5UG3HL163121-02,2-Generation Interventions to Improve Cardiovascular Health in Indiana and Illinois Through Home Visiting (2-NOURISH),"PROJECT SUMMARY This application proposing the 2-GeneratioN Interventions to ImprOve CardiovascUlaR Health in Indiana and IllinoiS Through Home Visiting (2-NOURISH) is in response to the RFA “Early Intervention to Promote Cardiovascular Health of Mothers and Children (ENRICH) Multisite Clinical Center (RFA-HL-22-007)”. Given growing rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, interventions to optimize maternal cardiovascular health (CVH) are urgently needed. Poor maternal CVH is also associated with poor offspring CVH. As a result, the perinatal period is an opportune time to intervene, but evidence-based interventions are limited. Home visiting (HV) programs serve as an ideal setting to conduct intervention research aimed at improving maternal and child CVH as they already serve an at-risk population across the United States with a high prevalence of poor CVH. The proposed Clinical Center, 2-NOURISH, led by Northwestern, in partnership with two evidence-based HV models (Healthy Families America [HFA] and Parents as Teachers [PAT]), and an evidence-based virtual platform for lifestyle intervention, Weight Watchers International (WW), is uniquely qualified to participate in all aspects of the ENRICH Network and to substantially enhance the Network’s goals. In our application, we demonstrate key prior experiences, which include: (1) long-standing collaborations with HV models, including MPI Tandon’s evidence-based perinatal depression and stress management intervention (Mothers and Babies); (2) significant expertise in the development and assessment of maternal and child CVH, particularly during the perinatal period; and (3) extensive experience with recruitment and retention of diverse populations for behavior interventions. During the UG3 phase (Years 1-2), we will work collaboratively within the ENRICH Network to develop a common study protocol, adapt the intervention content, and conduct pilot tests. During the UH3 phase (Years 3-7), we will recruit 600 mother-child dyads in partnership with 40 HV programs in Illinois and Indiana within the proposed study timeline to achieve the ENRICH Network Goal of 3000 total dyads to examine the effectiveness of an implementation-ready, CVH-focused, evidence-based intervention. We carefully considered potential study designs and propose a Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Type 1 trial with a cluster randomized design that would randomize at the home visitor-level. Additionally, given the potential maternal and offspring benefits of intervention during pregnancy, we propose prenatal recruitment. Our proposed intervention also includes innovative prenatal (promotion of stress management techniques, home visitor patient navigation) and postpartum (intensive lifestyle intervention with a virtual delivery platform, peer support) components. Our Clinical Center is additionally committed to developing the skills of Early Stage Investigators related to clinical trial design and the skills of home visitors related to the construct of CVH, its components, and the common study protocol. 2-NOURISH is ideally suited to serve as a Clinical Center and contribute to the Network’s long-term mission to equitably improve maternal and early childhood CVH.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3234,449,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

1K99HL168338-01,"Developing, Validating, and Implementing an Epidemiological Instrument to Assess the Effect of Resistance Training on Measures of Cardiometabolic Disease","A. PROJECT SUMMARY Skeletal muscle is the most abundant insulin-sensitive tissue in the body making it an important organ system in the prevention of cardiometabolic disease. Resistance training is the physical activity modality that directly increases muscle hypertrophy and in doing so increases GLUT4 expression. GLUT4 is an insulin-regulated glucose transporter with the primary role of stimulating glucose uptake; therefore, hypertrophy leads to increased insulin sensitivity. Resistance training and enhanced insulin sensitivity have the potential to lower the burden of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. However, what we know about the role of resistance training on long-term health outcomes is limited by the blunt tools currently used to measure resistance training in longitudinal epidemiologic studies. Progress in the physical activity epidemiology field is limited because resistance training volume is not measured in population studies with the same level of precision as aerobic activity and as a result, we do not know the optimal balance of movements to promote health across the life course. The objective of the proposed research is to ameliorate the gap in assessing resistance training volume at an epidemiological level and assess how resistance training volume affects cardiovascular and metabolic disease independently and jointly with aerobic activity. The training will enable the scientific objectives of this application, which are to evaluate the independent and joint associations of resistance training with estimates of insulin resistance and blood pressure. This award will provide Dr. Booker with added training in 1) survey development, 2) resistance training, 3) cohort development, and 4) biostatistics. Training will take place at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, supported by a strong team of mentors from multiple peer institutions with expertise in each of these areas. In the K99 phase, Dr. Booker will develop and validate an epidemiological instrument to collect resistance training volume (Aim 1) and identify the age group where the instrument performs the best. During the R00 phase, Dr. Booker will use the instrument to determine the association of resistance training volume with estimates of insulin resistance and blood pressure (Aim 2). He will then determine the optimal ratio of movement behaviors for estimates of insulin resistance and blood pressure (Aim 3). The proposed training and research will propel Dr. Booker towards successfully achieving his long-term research goal of developing tailored physical activity training programs to promote ideal cardiovascular and metabolic health. Resistance training has emerged among the top fitness trends worldwide and has the potential to serve as another tool to lower the burden of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2852,417,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HL150729-09,The role of Pleckstrin-2 as a functional node in myeloid proliferation,"PROJECT SUMMARY Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of bone marrow diseases that show excessive myeloid cell production with an increased risk of developing thrombosis and evolving to acute myeloid leukemia. V617F driver mutation of JAK2 is one of the leading causes of MPNs. The discovery of this mutation led to the development of JAK inhibitors to treat MPNs. However, JAK inhibitors are not curative. In addition, MPN patients treated with JAK inhibitor often develop drug resistance and severe side effects due to the indispensable roles of JAK2 in normal hematopoiesis. We have been studying new approaches to treat MPNs, especially focusing on the downstream effectors of the JAK2 pathway. Our recently published studies funded by the current R01 revealed that loss of Pleckstrin-2 (Plek2), a novel target of the JAK2-STAT5 pathway, ameliorated JAK2V617F-induced myeloproliferative phenotypes, and more importantly reverted vascular occlusions and lethality of the JAK2V617F MPN mouse model. Given the significance of Plek2 in MPN pathogenesis, we have identified lead compounds of Plek2 small molecule inhibitors using in silico-based high- throughput screenings and cell-based assays. Our novel unpublished preliminary data further reveal that Plek2 binds to several PI3K effectors and loss of Plek2 reduces Akt activation. Preliminary in vivo evidence also demonstrates that Plek2 is critical for the PI3K-Akt pathway in that Plek2 knockout ameliorated myeloproliferation and significantly extended the survival of Pten hematopoietic specific knockout mice. These findings lead us to hypothesize that Plek2 functions as a central hub to connect the JAK2-STAT and the PI3K- Akt pathways and promote myeloproliferation. To test this hypothesis and investigate the mechanism of function of Plek2, we will use 1) in vitro biochemical and molecular studies to determine how Plek2 enhances the PI3K-Akt signaling, 2) Pten hematopoietic specific knockout mouse model to reveal the functions of Plek2 in vivo, and 3) pre-clinical MPN models and MPN patient samples to establish the efficacy of Plek2 inhibitors. Successful completion of this project will lead to novel insights into the role of Plek2 in the pathogenesis of MPNs and lay the foundation for clinical trials using Plek2 inhibitors as single agents or in combination with other compounds to treat MPNs.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2379,357,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R21AI171325-01A1,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia TfcA and TfcB: Antibacterial T4SS effectors from an emerging human pathogen,"PROJECT SUMMARY Gram- Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Sm) is an emergent, multi-drug resistant pathogen. Sm infection occurs throughout the body but is most often manifest as pneumonia. Sm is notable in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, often heightening risk of lung exacerbations, and its significance is increased further by recent reports of Sm infecting COVID-19 patients. Despite this clinical importance, knowledge of Sm is still relatively limited. Recently, we found that Sm encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that promotes, in a contact-dependent manner, apoptosis of macrophages, while blunting apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. Yet, perhaps even more significant was our finding that the Sm T4SS mediates, in contact-dependent fashion, killing of E. coli (Ec) and multiple clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), including those from CF patients. Thus, we posited that the antibacterial effect of Sm T4SS impacts human infection, as Sm and Pa are often together in water systems in hospitals and in various types of infections, especially in the (CF) lungs. Based on the analysis of mutants and their complements, we identified two putative effectors (TfcA and TfcB) as being required for the bactericidal activity of the Sm T4SS. A mutant lacking both these proteins was as impaired as a mutant lacking the T4SS apparatus, indicating that TfcA and TfcB account for (nearly all) the killing effects seen. Using both a 2-hybrid assay that measures binding to the T4SS coupling protein and an interbacterial protein translocation assay, we determined that TfcA and TfcB are bona fide substrates of the T4SS, a result confirmed by testing mutants lacking both the T4SS apparatus and the individual effectors. Delivery of cloned TfcA (alone) into the periplasm resulted in the killing of target bacteria, indicating that this effector is both necessary and sufficient for bactericidal activity. Bioinformatics suggested that TfcA is representative of a large but uncharacterized branch of microbial lipases, whereas TfcB appears to signify a large but ill-defined group of lysozyme-like enzymes. In contrast to the vast data re T4SSs impacting mammalian hosts and the many studies on the antibacterial role of type VI secretion systems, knowledge of the antibacterial role of T4SSs is very minimal. Indeed, Sm T4SS is thus far the only antibacterial T4SS reported for a human pathogen, and TfcA and TfcB its only documented bactericidal effectors. Thus, we propose to i) define the enzyme activities encoded by TfcA and TfcB, ii) discern if those activities promote killing of Pa and Ec, and iii) explore if Sm T4SS, TfcA, and TfcB also kill other co-inhabitants of the CF lung, ranging from other emerging Gram- bacteria to classic Gram+ pathogens to fungi. Besides improving our knowledge of Sm, the data obtained will have broad implications for the roles of other T4SSs and possible new links between T4SS effectors and anti-microbial therapies.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2971,462,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01DK129843-03,EAT: A Reliable Eating Assessment Technology for Free-living Individuals.,"Overeating and unhealthy eating are often associated with various health risk conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure, and some chronic diseases. To get a better understanding of overeating and unhealthy eating, researchers often rely on self-reports provided by individuals. Suggestions regarding changing lifestyle is often provided based on observations from these self-reports. However, it is well known that self-reports can be erroneous and subject to reporting biases. Thus, an objective way to measure the eating activity and validating self-reports is necessary. Recently, there has been growing interest in moving beyond self-reports and monitoring the eating activity automatically. To monitor automatically, and in real time, researchers have looked at using sensor data from wrist worn devices, neck-worn devices, or ear-worn devices to automatically detect eating. These devices often enable capturing the eating periods. However, these devices seldom capture images, thus limiting the possibility of visually confirming the consumed food and their quantity. With the increasing popularity of wearable cameras, it is gradually becoming possible to capture the eating activities and associated context automatically and without any user intervention. Advances in machine learning enables automatically extracting eating related information from these captured images. However, wearable cameras often capture more information than necessary, like capturing bystanders. This unnecessary information capturing reduces participant's willingness to wearing the camera. Currently, no camera exists that can capture the eating activity and at the same time limit capturing unnecessary information. Obfuscating the unnecessary information might increase participant's willingness to wear the camera. However, it is unclear if and which obfuscation technique will increase participant's willingness to don the wearable camera and at the same time ensure automatic context determination. In this project, we will determine the possibility of using machine learning to detect eating in videos and identify the obfuscation technique that can allow detecting the eating activity without collecting unnecessary information. To this end, first we will develop an activity detection algorithm that will allow detecting the eating activity using data from an IR sensor array and RGB images. Next, we will test various obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial and select the best obfuscation method based on the greatest participant acceptability. We will then deploy the eating detection algorithm with the best obfuscation approach on a novel wearable camera that has an infrared sensor array. We will use this camera to test the possibility of detecting eating in a real-world setting. To validate our algorithm, we will ask people to confirm or refute predicted eating and non-eating moments.

5R01GM115761-09,Capturing Transient Protein and Nucleic Acid Structures During Their Functions on Multiple Spatial and Temporal Scales,"Summary/Abstract The long term objective of the proposed research is to develop an integrated instrumentation capable of studying protein/nucleic acid structural dynamics that are relevant to their functions on the time scales from femtosecond to millisecond in order to gain new insight into correlations of active site structures and global conformations of these molecules. Snapshots of solution phase molecular structures over different spatial scales, from sub-Ångström for active sites to several nanometers for overall conformation, will be captured using time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy and scattering. These structural studies will be combined with advanced molecular dynamics simulations that will generate detailed atomistic dynamics consistent with measured scattering profiles over a wide-range of temporal scales from femtosecond to millisecond. The proposed research is complementary to single crystal X-ray diffraction, and intends to map reaction trajectories through three-dimensional structures as a function time in media that mimic biological environments. In order to detect structural changes in an ensemble, reaction triggers must be designed to create sudden environmental changes that synchronize actions of the molecules with much higher time resolution than traditional mixing. The program has three main innovations from previous studies: 1) to develop triggering sources beyond direct light excitation used in the past to initiate reactions to overcome the limitation that very few biological systems related to human health are light activated for their function; 2) to develop novel sample delivery system that reduces the sample consumption by a factor of 100 and enables many precious laboratory samples to be studied using the time-resolved X-ray methods; and 3) to develop a combined approach in data analyses using advanced molecular dynamics simulation coupled to time-dependent X-ray scattering data to extract structures with improved structural accuracy especially for those coexisting species. The above innovation in methodology will allow us to investigate a number of systems that are biologically significant for enzymatic reactions, signal sensing, protein/nucleic acid folding/unfolding as well as lipids phase transitions. Several systems are chosen for the proposed studies to capture transient structures of, a) local metal center and global protein conformations of cytochrome c oxidase model proteins triggered by photodissociation of inhibitors; b) protein folding induced by calcium ion a concentration jump; c) temperature-induced RNA conformational changes sensing signal for translation; d) pH-dependent DNA structures for human oncogene regulation and e) pH-responsive lipid nanocarrier assembly for anticancer drug delivery. These structural results combined with those of reaction kinetics from optical transient spectroscopy will provide guidance for modulating protein and nucleic acid functions via structural modifications, which will lead to impacts in drug design, enzymatic function enhancement, catalysis, as well as theoretical calculations.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3112,430,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5P01AI145818-05,Chronic Rhinosinusitis Integrative Studies Program 2 (CRISP2),"The Chronic Rhinosinusitis Integrative Studies Program 2 (CRISP2) is an integrated program of epidemiologists, otolaryngologists, allergists and immunologists with highly collaborative studies to better understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease heterogeneity and how these mechanisms translate into clinical phenotypes, natural history and long term outcomes. There is a compelling need for more research in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Patients with CRS experience a dramatic decrement in quality of life, CRS has a prevalence approaching 12%, nearly half a million patients per year undergo surgery and the estimated total costs of CRS in the US are $22-32 billion per year. Hypotheses and themes of CRISP2 are: 1.) Heterogeneous underlying pathogenic mechanisms yield variable clinical phenotypic manifestations; 2.) Comorbidity of sinus disease and lung disease tracks with selected molecular endotypes; 3.) There are profound differences between mechanisms and manifestations of CRS in men and women; 4.) Pathogenic mechanisms of CRSsNP, the more prevalent form of disease, have not been well studied; 5.) There is a significant need to study CRS in primary care populations; 6.) New assays are needed to evaluate molecular endotypes in an outpatient setting. This grant addresses all of these hypotheses and themes. Relating molecular endotypes to clinical manifestations, natural history, comorbidity and outcomes of disease is an overarching goal of this program. Three projects and two cores (Administrative Core A and Clinical, Laboratory and Data Management Core B) comprise the CRISP2 program. The three main project main aims are: Project 1-To study the mechanisms of epithelial barrier dysfunction and tissue hyperplasia in CRS. Project 1 will use a novel microparticle (MP) based assay of epithelial differentiation and will assay components of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems to test the hypothesis that fibrin deposition, barrier dysfunction and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) play important pathogenic roles in CRS. These responses will be related to immunological endotypes, clinical phenotypes, comorbidity and clinical outcomes. Project 2-To dissect molecular endotypes and relate them to manifestations of CRS. Project 2 will test the hypothesis that inflammation in CRS is heterogeneous and that inflammatory endotypes control clinical phenotypes of CRS. Preliminary results implicate select endotypes as inducers of certain symptom constellations and have led to hypotheses about the cells and molecules that drive the main immunological endotypes, type 1, 2 and 3. Both Project 1 and Project 2 will utilize large sample sets from patients at both Geisinger (Project 3) and NU (Core B). Project 3-To use population-based CRS epidemiology to evaluate sex differences, natural history, and long-term outcomes based on clinically-defined phenotypes and biologically- based endotypes. Large retrospective cohort and longitudinal epidemiological studies proposed include an ongoing study of nearly 8000 study subjects; an EHR-based retrospective study of 10,000 patients and 20,000 controls; a longitudinal study of 450 subjects; and case-control studies of risk factors for bronchiectasis.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3246,464,1.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R21HD107571-02,Identification of Risk Factors for predicting outcomes of COVID-19-Related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC) using Real World Clinical Data,"There is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to significant post-infection inflammatory syndromes in pediatric patient populations, including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). There are multiple critical gaps in our understanding of risk factors and biomarkers for developing MIS-C, severe MIS-C requiring ICU admission, and the development of severe cardiovascular complications. It also remains unclear whether post-COVID MIS-C is a monophasic “one time” inflammatory condition or represents the onset of chronic inflammatory disease and possible autoimmunity, which makes post-discharge rheumatological management challenging. Furthermore, rational stratification of MIS-C patients for specific therapeutic approaches has been challenging due to lack of data from large, population representative cohorts. Since many health systems, including our own, have small populations of pediatric MIS-C patients, it is difficult to understand the full scope and breadth of MIS-C presentation within a single site. We propose to leverage electronic health record (EHR) data from the Chicago Area Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN) to describe and characterize MIS-C patient populations. CAPriCORN includes 12 health systems across Chicago, including 3 pediatric hospitals and diverse care settings, and provides access to a comprehensive array of imaging and laboratory tests along with primary demographic and clinical data collected during routine care for MIS-C patients. In this proposal, we will (1) use well-characterized pediatric cohorts at UW-Madison and Lurie Children's Hospital to develop algorithms to identify and characterize patients with MIS-C following SARS-CoV2 infection in EHR data and assess these algorithms in local and regional datasets; and (2) use cohort data from CAPriCORN to determine if specific clinical and laboratory attributes associate with short-term and long-term MIS-C outcomes. Thus, this project will harness the wealth of a large population medical record data to bring novel insights into the relationship between key clinical data collected during the context of care for patients pre, during- and post-SARS-CoV2 infection and development and severity of post-COVID inflammatory disease in children.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2284,314,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01CA243249-05,Understanding Progesterone Receptor action in Obesity for Endometrial Cancer Prevention,"The incidence of endometrial cancer is on the rise each year reaching over 60,000 new cases in the US in 2018. Obesity remains a significant public health problem and is a major risk factor for developing endometrial cancer. Although excess estrogen from adipose tissues is thought to predispose a woman from developing endometrial cancer, the protective role of progesterone in obesity is unknown. Studies demonstrate that the excess estrogen theory in obese women does not always hold true particularly in the premenopausal state. We hypothesize that adipose tissue release factors that activate the AKT pathway in endometrial epithelial cells to blunt progesterone receptor (PR) action, thereby increasing the risk of endometrial neoplasia. In this study, we will decipher the actions of PR in the human endometrium in the presence or absence of adipocytes using 3D spheroid cultures in microfluidic systems. These innovative technologies allow us to study for the first time, the effect of adipocytes on the signaling and genomic activities that affect progesterone sensitivity. We will determine how adipocytes affect progesterone driven differentiation and survival of the endometrial organoids and how changes in epigenetics, including DNA methylation and histone marks, affect the ER and PR cistrome. Unbiased sequencing will be done using technologies that allow for deep sequencing of small cell numbers. This research will generate insight into the early changes that may lead to tumorigenesis which will be useful to determine how to effectively prevent endometrial cancer in the obese women who are at high risk.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,1625,248,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5P50CA271353-02,Scalable TELeheaLth Cancer CARe:  The STELLAR Program to Treat Cancer Risk Behaviors,"The proposed research center for Scalable TELeheaLth Cancer CARe (STELLAR) is grounded in the Institute of Medicine (IOM) vision that quality cancer care includes not only treatment of the disease, but also promotion of the patient’s long-term health and quality of life. Cancer risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity, obesity1) are associated with poor treatment response, treatment-related side effects, heightened recurrence risk, decreased longevity, diminished quality of life (QOL), and increased treatment cost for many cancers2-8. These risk behaviors are at least as prevalent in cancer patients as they are in healthy adults, but referral pathways to treat them are not routinely integrated into cancer care. By integrating cancer risk behavior assessment into the EHR and automating referral, we plan to make telehealth-enabled treatment of health risk behaviors (a clinical service called health promotion) accessible to cancer providers and patients throughout Northwestern’s clinical practice network in a manner that is affordable, improves care quality, and is minimally disruptive to clinical workflow. The MPIs of this proposal have developed, and are experts at, remotely assessing patient symptoms and delivering effective, inexpensive, telehealth treatment of cancer’s most prevalent and potent, behavioral risk factors. physical inactivity9, obesity10, smoking11 Our preliminary data suggest that telehealth, as compared to in-person cancer care, may make treatment more accessible to older adults and minorities. With Cancer Moonshot and other funds, we have collectively developed patient-reported assessment, symptom management, and shared decision-making tools that are integrated into the single EHR (Epic) system that links the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Corporation’s (NMHC)11-hospital healthcare delivery system. We also developed a smoking cessation program offered throughout NMHC. In response to demand from NM’s Cancer Quality Improvement group, we now propose to implement, optimize, evaluate, and disseminate a more comprehensive, fully integrated, patient-centered, technology-assisted telehealth risk behavior treatment program that proactively addresses physical inactivity, obesity, and tobacco use for cancer patients in the NMHC system. We plan a pragmatic trial to test its impact on equitable care access, health outcomes, care quality, care utilization, provider-patient communication, patient-reported outcomes, and cost.

5K08HL159356-03,Mechanisms of regulatory T-cell mediated endothelial repair following viral pneumonia in aged hosts,"The broad objectives of this K08 proposal are two-fold: 1) to facilitate development of the necessary skills that will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming a successful physician-scientist focusing on determinants of recovery from viral pneumonia in aged hosts, and 2) to investigate the mechanisms that direct the Tregs to orchestrate resolution of severe lung injury throughout the lifespan. The candidate and her mentors have designed a detailed training plan tailored to the candidate's specific needs and goals. The plan includes a rigorous research component that will afford the PI new knowledge and research skills to better examine the links between a critical immune cell population and the endothelium during recovery from viral pneumonia. The proposal concerns viral pneumonia, specifically influenza-induced lung injury, its clinical counterpart the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and how they both disproportionately affect the elderly population. Despite decades of dedicated research, there are only a few anti-viral therapies with limited efficacy to manage severe viral pneumonia. Tregs have been shown to decrease inflammation and promote tissue repair in diverse murine models of lung injury. Tregs also increase in the lungs of patients with ARDS, suggesting that they may play a role in the human adaptive immune response to lung injury. However, the specific mechanisms that cause Tregs to execute their pro-repair program following lung injury remain unknown. Our preliminary data shows that the youthful reparative Treg cell program following influenza-induced lung injury is dominated by biologic processes linked to the development and repair of blood capillaries. This reparative program is lost in aged hosts in a cell- autonomous manner. Thus, we hypothesize that aging results in Treg cell-specific downregulation of important pro-angiogenic factors expression such as VEGFA, leading to impaired alveolar endothelial repair and recovery from viral pneumonia. The long-term goal of the proposal is to identify novel small molecule- and cell-based therapeutics to control inflammation and promote tissue repair in our increasingly older population. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) determine whether age-related alterations in the pro- endothelial repair function of Tregs results from cell-autonomous or microenvironmentally-driven changes, 2) determine whether Treg cell-generated VEFGA is necessary and sufficient to restore the pro-endothelial repair function present in youth that is lost with aging, and 3) determine whether age-related VEGFA expression in alveolar Tregs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is associated with 30-day mortality in patients with severe viral pneumonia. We will use standard techniques to assess severity of lung injury, endothelial repair, heterochronic (age mis-matched) adoptive Treg cell transfer, multiple transgenic murine strains for loss-of-function and gain- of-function experiments, flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and transcriptional profiling with RNA-sequencing as the primary methods to support the experimental design of this proposal.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3204,454,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls.

5U18DP006524-04,"Effects of Medicaid Coverage and State-Level Delivery Approaches on Healthcare Quality, Outcomes, and Costs for Adults with Diabetes","Project Summary Despite tremendous advances in diabetes, many Americans continue to have poor control over risk factors such as blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol. As a result, diabetes continues to be a leading cause of death and many preventable complications, such as heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, visual loss, and amputation. Many adults with diabetes still lack access to a coordinated healthcare team and do not complete evidence-based preventive services, receive medications or technologies that may improve disease care, participate in self-management behaviors, or follow-up for early detection and treatment of comorbidities and complications. This gap between evidence and practice disproportionately impacts the aged, those with disabilities, and the poor. As the primary health insurer for these vulnerable groups, Medicaid policies that expand eligibility requirements or lower barriers for initiating high value medications have the potential to improve healthcare engagement, delivery, and outcomes. States have a great deal of flexibility in administering Medicaid programs, and the Affordable Care Act and other health reforms further catalyzed state-level variation in eligibility, coverage, population management services, and financing. This variation presents a tremendous opportunity for natural experiments to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and costs of policy shifts on the care and outcomes of diabetes in vulnerable groups for whom the burden of diabetes is highest. We propose a Natural Experimental Research Center that will evaluate: 1) health and economic effects of state-specific variation in Medicaid managed care approaches for pharmacy utilization management affecting a newer class of diabetes medications with high costs but unique benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors; and 2) the medium- to longer-term effects of ACA expansion of health insurance coverage for adults with diabetes. We will leverage our access to two unique longitudinal datasets: (i) national claims data from UnitedHealth Group, a major Medicaid managed care provider for 6 million people in 27 states; and (ii) multi-state (Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin) electronic heath records linked to Medicaid and Medicare claims. Outcomes of interest will include medication adherence, diabetes care quality, cardiometabolic risk factor control, acute diabetes complications, other forms of healthcare utilization, and costs. To evaluate state policies for medication utilization management, we will use difference-in-differences designs involving matched comparators in states with different policies. We will use the linked EHR-claims data from three states in novel, hybrid regression discontinuity (RD) and DiD designs to study the longer-term effects of ACA insurance expansion. Through direct engagement of collaborators and data contributors in participating states, our studies have been designed around high priority questions involving the effectiveness of particular programs. These studies are of high interest to state Medicaid programs and their managed care partners in all states, and our results will be communicated to them to guide policy decisions and to facilitate new natural experiments in the future.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3250,457,1.0,False,False,0.07142857142857142,phase2_nih
5U18DP006709-02,"A Sentinel Network for Evaluation of the Reach, Implementation, Effectiveness, and Costs of Evidence-Based Lifestyle Interventions to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes in U.S. Adults","Project Summary Despite tremendous advances in diabetes, Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S., and more than 1.5 million more Americans develop T2D every year. More than half of those new cases could be prevented or delayed if high risk adults were offered resource-intensive lifestyle intervention programs while they have prediabetes – a readily identifiable stage of abnormal glucose metabolism that precedes the development of type 2 diabetes. Currently, 88 million Americans have prediabetes, but about 5 in 6 of them is unaware, and fewer than 1% have participated in an intensive lifestyle intervention. CDC created the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) to address the increasing burden of type 2 diabetes in the United States. The NDPP lifestyle change program is offered through CDC recognized organizations, including community-based organizations, hospitals, provider groups, pharmacies, and health plans in a variety of delivery approaches (in person, online, remote classroom or telehealth). Since 2018, the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) has also offered a structured lifestyle intervention program designed to prevent type 2 diabetes in individuals 65 years and older with prediabetes. We propose to develop and implement a collaborative research data collection and evaluation plan that emphasizes the unique, complementary strengths of several organizations with experience supporting the delivery of National DPP and/or Medicare DPP interventions to reach diverse populations in multiple contexts and in multiple formats. Our proposal will integrate several sources of data needed to successfully evaluate participation barriers and facilitators, effectiveness, costs, and cost-effectiveness of efforts to implement evidence-based diabetes prevention services as part of the NDPP and MDPP. In collaboration with large health systems and DPP suppliers in several representative “sentinel” locations nationally, we will collect, manage, harmonize, and analyze multiple data sources, including: (1) health system partner data regarding participant eligibility characteristics, participation barriers and facilitators, and change in biometric outcomes over time; (2) NDPP supplier data regarding attendance levels, weight changes, participant experience, and implementation challenges; and (3) large health payer data for traditional Medicare beneficiaries nationally, UnitedHealthCare (UHC) commercially ensured health plan enrollees nationally, UHC Medicare Advantage enrollees nationally, and UHC Medicaid Managed Care enrollees in select states that participate in NDPP.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2663,366,1.0,False,False,0.07142857142857142,phase2_nih
1K23MH129607-01A1,Clarifying the Role of Psychomotor Retardation in Reward-Based Reinforcement Learning Deficits in MDD: A Computational and fMRI Study,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and costly mental health disorder. A potentially important contributor to MDD is impaired reward-based reinforcement learning (RBRL). RBRL are a set of processes reflecting difficulty learning which actions are likely to lead to rewarding outcomes, and are clinically significant features of MDD that predicts future depressive symptoms and worse treatment response. MDD, however, is heterogeneous and RBRL may relate to particular MDD symptoms - specifically psychomotor retardation (PmR), a vastly understudied but impairing aspect of MDD that may be especially detrimental for RBRL. Despite overlapping neural circuitry between PmR and RBRL, no study has assessed the impact of PmR on RBRL- related behavior and neural activity in MDD. This is a critical question, as the degree to which RBRL is impaired and which RBRL processes are altered in MDD may depend on PmR. Furthermore, this is highly clinically relevant as ameliorating RBRL deficits related to PmR in MDD may depend on targeting specific RBRL processes. Thus, the overall goal of the proposed K23 is to clarify the role of PmR on RBRL deficits in MDD using innovative computational modeling to parse specific RBRL processes and fMRI. Building on an ongoing R01 (PIs: Dr. Shankman, Mittal, Walther [mentors on this K23]), Aim 1 will test whether experimentally manipulating the demand for psychomotor speed impacts behavioral and neural indicators of RBRL in individuals (ages 18-60) with MDD (N=66) vs. healthy controls (N=44). Aim 2 will test whether a fine-grained laboratory assessment of PmR in MDD predicts behavioral and neural indicators of RBRL, and whether associations between PmR and RBRL are stronger when faster psychomotor speed is required. Aim 3 will examine whether PmR-related RBRL impairment in MDD predicts the course of depression over 1-year. The proposed career development award also aims to provide Dr. Letkiewicz with experiences and training activities that will support her goals of increasing her knowledge of (1) the neural and behavioral basis of psychomotor functioning in MDD, (2) advanced computational modeling to assess reinforcement learning in the context of psychomotor symptoms, (3) multimethod RDoC approaches to studying mechanisms of psychopathology, and (4) grantsmanship and mentorship skills. Her training goals will primarily be accomplished through formal didactics, training with her mentorship team, and the interdisciplinary centers and institutes at Northwestern University. Her mentorship team consists of leading experts in MDD and transdiagnostic research (Dr. Shankman), reinforcement learning and computational modeling (Dr. Kahnt), neuroimaging and motor systems (Dr. Mittal), and psychomotor assessment (Dr. Walther), all of whom have all have active NIH grants and an excellent track record of mentoring early career scientists.

1R01EY034740-01,Novel ocular imaging and molecular analysis of anterior eye segment for glaucoma,"Project Summary Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and is a heterogeneous group of ocular diseases characterized by optic nerve damage and impaired vision. The majority of glaucoma patients are elderly due to the age-related, optic nerve disease, whereas there are early-onset forms of glaucoma: primary congenital glaucoma and developmental glaucoma. The resistance to drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior segment of the eye into the systemic circulation leads to the elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), and elevated IOP is the primary and only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. Despite the current treatment options aimed at lowering IOP, there are urgent needs to develop new, more effective therapeutic approaches. Aqueous humor drainage as the conventional outflow pathway is mediated through the trabecular meshwork (TM), which is derived from the neural crest (NC) lineage, into a specialized, lymphatic-like vessel known as Schlemm's canal (SC). Recent evidence indicates that SC has specialized and unique vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and that the signaling pathways such as Angiopoietin/Tie2 are essential for the formation and maintenance of SC vasculature. The long-term goal of our group is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that regulate SC maintenance/function and to understand how disruption of these mechanisms leads to impaired outflow causing increased IOP in pathological settings. To image the full-circle SC and evaluate TM stiffness in mice, our group has recently developed a circular-scanning visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) system. FOXC2 is a member of the FOX (Forkhead box) transcription factor family and has critical roles in vascular development and disease. Inactivating mutations in human FOXC2 are dominantly associated with lymphedema, which is characterized by obstructed lymph drainage in the limbs, and recent evidence has shown that FOXC2 variants possess a role as putative modifiers for the development of primary congenital glaucoma. However, its role in TM and SC cells has yet to be fully investigated. The results from our preliminary experiments via vis-OCT imaging, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing indicate that the NC-Foxc2-/- mutation is associated with defective TM formation, abnormal SC morphology, or the absence of the SC, a reduction in expression of PROX1, VEGFR3, and TEK in SC ECs, and elevated IOP, and that the EC-Foxc2-/- mutation results in impaired SC formation. Our central hypothesis is that novel diagnostic vis-OCT imaging techniques elucidate the significance of Foxc2 function in both NC-derived TM cells and SC ECs in SC formation/maintenance and TM stiffness. To test this hypothesis, we have two Specific Aims. First, we will develop a new balanced-detection vis-OCT to determine the anatomical influence of the Foxc2 regulatory network in SC formation/maintenance. Second, we will develop new methodologies to evaluate TM stiffness based on vis-OCT phase imaging after high-speed temporal speckle reduction to define the functional influence of the Foxc2 regulatory network in TM stiffness and ECM compositions.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3158,465,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5U01DA055355-03,9/24- Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium,"Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments. Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established based on a sufficiently large and demographically heterogeneous sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Consortium has been formed to deploy a harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,200 mothers and infants enrolled at 27 sites across the United States (US). The HBCD Study will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD Consortium Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD Data Coordinating Center (HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD Study is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a varied cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD Study will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-of-the-art methods.

5R01AI141532-05,Aedes antiviral RNAi pathway,"SUMMARY Arboviruses remain an immense public health threat, causing yearly large epidemics. The overarching aim of this research is to better understand the role of the Aedes aegypti RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in antiviral defense and innate immunity, and to generate knowledge and tools for the development of new methods to control arbovirus transmission. Population replacement of wild-type with genetically modified mosquitoes incapable of pathogen transmission is emerging as a promising complement to other disease control methods. Because Ae. aegypti transmits multiple arbovirus pathogens that are frequently sympatric, it is important for a transgenic mosquito to be resistant to multiple pathogens. The siRNA pathway-mediated antiviral defense system is known to act against a broad range of viruses. However, despite the RNAi pathway's emergence as the major pan-antiviral defense system it remains understudied in mosquitoes. Our research plan is designed to test the overarching hypothesis that the A. aegypti proteins, Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), R2D2 and Argonaute-2 (Ago-2), are key components mediating an RNA silencing response that is broadly protective against arbovirus infections. We will use of siRNA-deficient loss-of-function mutants and transgenic mosquitoes over-expressing Dcr-2, Ago-2 and R2D2 that will be generated in Aim 1. With these genetic tools we will clarify the temporal and spatial specificity of the antiviral response in Aim 2, and investigate possible inter-tissue signaling and regulation of vertical transmission in Aim 3.

5R37NS054791-17,Functional Analysis of Mrgpr Family in itch sensation,"Project Summary The goal of our research is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chronic itch, a disease that interferes with normal daily activity and can have serious clinical consequences. Many pathological conditions can lead to chronic itch such as localized skin diseases or more systemic conditions like cholestasis and kidney failure. Itch can also be a side effect of many therapeutic drugs. Current therapies including antihistamines are ineffective in most chronic itch conditions suggesting the involvement of histamine independent pathways. A major hurdle in understanding histamine-independent itch is the lack of knowledge about the receptors directly activated by non-histaminergic stimuli. Primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) play an essential role in detecting itch. Our lab has identified members of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Mrgpr family that are specifically expressed in DRG and function as itch receptors. Recently we showed that MrgprA1 in mice and its human homologue MRGPRX4 function as novel itch receptors, detecting bilirubin and bile acids (BAs). More importantly, we demonstrated that MrgprA1/X4 play an essential role for mediating cholestatic pruritus (itch), a condition resulting in elevated bilirubin and BAs due to bile duct blockage. Our preliminary data suggest that MrgprA1 are novel receptors for various therapeutic drugs and mediates drug-induced itch side effect. Preliminary data show that MrgprA1 also contributes to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Furthermore, previous studies and our preliminary data suggest BAs are also mediators for uremic pruritus. In this proposal, we will take a multidisciplinary approach to test the hypothesis that MrgprA1/X4 are itch receptors and mediate itch caused by different disease conditions including medication caused itch side effect, ACD, and kidney disease which dramatically impact the quality of patient's life and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In Aim I, we will test the hypothesis that some of drugs with itch side effect are pruritogens themselves by directly activating pruriceptive (itch sensing) neurons via MrgprA1 using mouse genetics, pharmacology, in vitro Ca2+ imaging, electrophysiology, and in vivo DRG imaging. In Aim II, we will test the hypothesis that MrgprA1 in sensory nerves and its peptide agonist NPFF released from nearby mast cells in the skin contributes to ACD itch using different ACD mouse models combined with mouse genetics and pharmacological approaches. In addition, we will determine whether pruriceptive neurons are activated under ACD conditions and if so whether MrgprA1 and NPFF mediate the activation using in vivo DRG GCaMP imaging. In Aim III, we will employ two uremic itch mouse models, an adenine-induced or a uremic itch patient plasma injection model to test the hypothesis that BAs mediate uremic itch by activating MRGPRX4 expressed in mouse DRG neurons. Moreover, we will identify other itch mediators present in patient plasma who are receiving hemodialysis due to kidney failure. The results of this project will provide insight into key itch mechanisms and open the door for the development of novel itch therapeutics.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3220,482,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5DP2AI164306-04,Tolerance-programming biomaterial-based Intranasal ASIT for the treatment of autoimmunity,"1. Abstract: The number of patients with autoimmunity and other antigen-specific immunoregulatory disorders is increasing worldwide at a rate of 4 to 8% per annum. Current therapies for autoimmunity only treat disease symptoms and are systemically immunosuppressive, resulting in an increased risk of infection and malignancy. The Holy Grail of autoimmune therapies would specifically abrogate pathogenic autoantigen-specific immune response. To this end, we propose the development of a novel biomaterial- based intranasal antigen-specific immunotherapy engineered to elicit auto-antigen specific regulatory T cells that control autoimmunity. Our in intranasal AIST is composed of autoantigens conjugated to a water- soluble polymer that binds to nasal mucus, facilitates paracellular transport across the nasal epithelium, and targets autoantigens and tolerance-programming small molecules (i.e., minocycline and dexamethasone) to underlying nasal DCs, resulting in the induction of autoantigen-specific regulatory T cells that suppress autoimmune responses. In this application, we propose: (1) the synthesis of our novel intranasal ASIT, (2) the demonstration of the ability of our platform to suppress antigen-specific immune responses, and (3) the use of our platform to treat and prevent experimental autoimmune myocarditis. Completion of this project will deliver a clinically viable treatment for autoimmune myocarditis and a therapeutic platform that can be easily tailored to treat other diseases driven by antigen-specific immune dysregulation, including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, transplant rejection, and numerous allergies.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,1642,220,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5K01MH122702-05,The Elders' Resilience Curriculum: Toward Building Empirical Evidence for a Culturally Grounded American Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Intervention,"PROJECT SUMMARY Suicide disproportionately affects American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, with the greatest burden experienced by AI/AN children and adolescents. A paucity of mental health care resources in AI/AN settings points to a critical need to deliver suicide prevention interventions outside conventional mental health clinical settings. Past research has shown cultural protective factor approaches will be more effective than risk- focused interventions to reduce AI/AN youth suicide. Culturally grounded (or “ground up”) prevention interventions—which place local culture and values at the forefront of intervention design, implementation, and evaluation—hold strong promise to prevent AI/AN youth suicide. However, we know little about core components, mechanisms, and constructs through which culturally grounded interventions can prevent suicide. The Elders’ Resilience Curriculum (ERC) is a school-based, culturally grounded, suicide prevention intervention currently delivered by White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) Elders through monthly lessons about tribal cultural values, beliefs, ways of life, and Apache language to youth ages 9-14, a nascent stage prior to the highest risk period for suicide (15-24 years old) in this community. The proposed research builds upon the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health and WMAT’s 35+ year research and public health partnership that continues to innovate and scale prevention interventions through community-based participatory research. The candidate will engage with the tribal-university partners to conduct an Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods study to identify key suicide protective factors and ERC core components that target these factors, refine a theoretical model specifying causal mechanisms and outcomes, develop a culturally adapted assessment battery, and pilot a rigorous evaluation to test the theoretical model and culturally adapted measures to prepare for a larger R01 effectiveness study. If successful, new understanding of the mechanisms and constructs through which ERC operates to prevent AI/AN youth suicide will support replication and scaling of this intervention to other AI/AN communities suffering youth suicide disparities. The proposed K01 will provide the candidate, who is from the Cherokee/Seminole Nations, with critical training in qualitative and mixed methods research, culturally grounded intervention design and evaluation, and child/adolescent development as it relates to resiliency, cultural identity, and suicide prevention. The candidate will receive guidance and targeted training from a mentorship team of national experts at the forefront of Indigenous mental health prevention science. This K01 award will support her to become an Indigenous NIMH independent investigator focused on culturally-informed, strengths-based mental health promotion research. The proposed research and candidate’s career goals align with NIMH Strategic Objective 4 to “strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research” and “identify, validate, and scale-up innovative programs currently in use that improve mental health services for underserved populations” (4.1).",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3193,432,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5F31GM148067-03,Defining the Role of DDX6 in Regulating FUS Condensates,"PROJECT SUMMARY Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a nuclear RNA binding protein that undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). When mislocalized and/or dysregulated, aberrant phase separation of FUS leads to the formation of pathogenic solid-like aggregates that are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We have recently discovered that reduction of DDX6, an RNA helicase known to interact with FUS, significantly diminishes cytoplasmic FUS granule formation during stress in neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Our preliminary results show that (i) DDX6 modulates FUS condensate number and size in a concentration dependent manner in vitro i.e., DDX6 promotes FUS condensate formation at low concentrations but limits growth above a finite level and (ii) DDX6 forms a discontinuous ring around FUS condensates. Building on these exciting results, I aim to test the hypothesis that DDX6 regulates FUS granules through dual roles as a granule nucleator and Pickering agent. Pickering agents are particles with distinct properties which adsorb to the surface of condensates, promoting their liquidity and maintaining small condensate size. Based on our results, we propose that DDX6 promotes FUS granule nucleation while its role as a Pickering agent maintains small droplet size and liquidity, thus preventing pathogenic aggregation. Additionally, we predict that ATP binding and RNA structure will affect the activity of DDX6 on FUS granules. We will test these predictions in three aims. Aim 1 will utilize in vitro condensation assays to evaluate the interaction between DDX6, FUS, RNA and ATP and to establish whether DDX6 acts as a Pickering agent. Aim 2 will utilize biochemical and single molecule assays to characterize the molecular-level dynamics of the interaction between FUS, DDX6, and RNA, and its dependence on ATP. Finally, aim 3 will use cell-based methods to investigate how tuning intracellular DDX6 concentrations and disrupting ATP binding affects FUS granule formation in wildtype and ALS-associated mutants. Together, this work will lead to a deeper understanding of RNA-protein granule regulation which is of utmost importance to treating neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTD.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2288,336,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5K23HL155730-03,Impact of Nocturnal Hypoxemia on Glucose during Sleep in High Altitude Sleep Disordered Breathing,"PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a highly prevalent disease that is associated with increased risk for incident diabetes. Mechanisms of SDB-induced dysglycemia have not been elucidated. Hypoxemia has been implicated as a key pathogenic factor in the development of glucose intolerance and diabetes. High altitude populations, who experience chronic hypoxia, represent unique cohorts to study the role of nocturnal hypoxemia in the pathogenesis of SDB-related diabetes. Our group previously demonstrated that severity of nocturnal hypoxemia, independent of daytime oxyhemoglobin saturation, was associated with elevated hemoglobin A1c. To date, no study has shown that targeting nocturnal hypoxemia improves glucose control. In this application, we will investigate the hypothesis that nocturnal hypoxemia causes dynamic nocturnal glucose elevations, that are mitigated by oxygen. We will employ continuous glucose monitoring to examine the temporal association between glucose and oxygenation dynamics in an observational study and examine the effects of nocturnal oxygen supplementation in a randomized cross-over study. Successful completion of this proposal will provide mechanistic proof that nocturnal hypoxia is a reversible cause of dysglycemia in highlanders. The applicant, Dr. Luu Pham, is a physician in Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, who seeks to develop a research career focused on the pathogenesis of SDB-related metabolic diseases. This proposal would allow the applicant dedicated time to conduct the outlined research project, as well as pursue didactic training in design and conduct of clinical trials and further quantitative methods relevant to this project and future research plans. The data generated from this research proposal will form the basis for an R01 application to examine the impact of treating of hypoxemia in the pathogenesis diabetes. The career development plan for this applicant includes a structured approach to mentoring, didactic coursework focused on a specific research goal, participation in local and national meetings and identification and regular assessment of career milestones. The research environment provided by Johns Hopkins University as well as the mentorship team described in this application will assist in Dr. Pham’s successful completion of his career and research goals. The Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Johns Hopkins University have a long history of training successful young clinical researchers. The pre-existing high-altitude research infrastructure and trained field staff, as well as the applicant’s established and ongoing collaboration with his team of mentors, will ensure that the study goals will be completed within the timeframe of this award. We have assembled a mentoring team of established faculty with distinct, complementary strengths in high altitude research, clinical trials, metabolic sequelae of SDB and biostatistics, relevant to this proposal. In addition, each member of the mentoring committee serves as an excellent role model for the applicant’s career development into an independent investigator.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3152,449,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1U01DA060708-01,"Phase III double-blind, randomized controlled trial of suvorexant versus placebo to treat insomnia in persons with opioid use disorder","Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a rapidly escalating public health crisis with recent evidence suggesting that close to 70% of drug overdose deaths involved opioids in the last year. Medications for OUD (MOUDs) such as buprenorphine and methadone are the frontline treatment for OUD, yet over half of individuals who initiate MOUD relapse or leave treatment in the first year, highlighting the importance of adjunctive therapies that might improve OUD treatment outcomes. Insomnia is a common and often recalcitrant issue among persons on MOUDs but there is little guidance on how to ameliorate symptoms of insomnia during OUD treatment. The orexin (or hypocretin) neurotransmitter system plays a role in insomnia and in the onset, progression, and maintenance of OUD. Suvorexant is a dual-orexin receptor antagonists that is FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, and data from our group suggests that suvorexant might be especially efficacious in treating insomnia in persons with OUD and may also confer collateral benefits including decreased opioid craving and symptoms of withdrawal. Moreover, suvorexant has an excellent safety profile and did not result in increased adverse events or measures of abuse potential when compared to placebo in our pilot study. The proposed study is an FDA-regulatory-grade Phase III multisite randomized-controlled trial of suvorexant versus placebo in persons with insomnia who are utilizing long-term MOUD treatment. Participants who are prescribed buprenorphine or methadone for OUD will be screened to determine study eligibility. Eligible individuals will be enrolled for an 8-week study that includes the following conditions: one night double-dummy placebo lead-in prior to randomization; ~8 weeks of suvorexant or placebo where the dose may be escalated from 10 mg to 20 mg after 3 nights (consistent with current suvorexant label instructions); and two-nights double-dummy placebo lead-out to examine discontinuation effects. In lab polysomnography (PSG) will be used to at the beginning and end of the trial to determine the primary endpoint of change from baseline total sleep time. Adverse events and other indicators of patient safety will be monitored throughout the study. Participants will also be assessed for OUD treatment outcomes including regular urine toxicology and trajectories of mental health during the study. Specific Aims of the study are to (Aim 1) evaluate the efficacy of suvorexant versus placebo in treat insomnia in persons taking buprenorphine or methadone for OUD treatment, (Aim1) Evaluate the safety of suvorexant versus placebo in persons taking buprenorphine or methadone for OUD treatment, (Aim 3) submit a Supplement Application of Efficacy to the FDA to support an update to the label of suvorexant, and (Exploratory Aim 4) determine whether suvorexant versus placebo improves OUD treatment outcomes. The results of this important study will inform treatment providers on whether suvorexant is safe and effective for insomnia in persons with OUD, and exploratory results will further our scientific understanding of the role of the orexin system in OUD treatment and recovery.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3161,477,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

Studied for over 50 years, investigations of soluble protein folding have proven invaluable for dissecting the molecular basis of a multitude of diseases. By comparison, folding studies of membrane proteins lag far behind. The knowledge gained from soluble protein studies cannot simply be transferred to inferences about because their solvents are different. The balance of forces encoding a MP embedded in a lipid bilayer must be distinct from that of soluble proteins in water. Our research efforts contribute to filling this key gap in the understanding the physical chemistry of membrane proteins. We will experimentally determine of energetic forces stabilizing membrane proteins along the steeply changing polarity gradient of the phospholipid bilayer interface, quantify backbone hydrogen bond strengths, and expand our repertoire of membrane protein folding models to include those with an a-helical secondary structure. These efforts will be complemented by molecular simulations and other solution biophysics interrogations as needed.

Her long-term career goal is to become a leader in patient-oriented research that informs and improves medical care for older adults with dementia through the development and implementation of care delivery interventions in clinical practice. This award will ensure she has the knowledge, skills, and experience to develop effective interventions, lead clinical trials, and translate research findings into routine clinical care. The career development plan proposes five years of informal and formal training in mixed methods research, intervention development and testing including clinical trials, and implementation science focused on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Dr. Amjad has convened an outstanding mentorship team with expertise in the relevant research methods, dementia care, primary care, and care for complex older adults. The proposal will take place in a rich scientific environment with the resources necessary to support her research, career development, and transition to independent clinical investigation. Despite the growing burden of dementia on patients, families, and health systems, the majority of older adults with dementia receive suboptimal care for dementia after diagnosis. Clinical practice guidelines for dementia care are available, but are not widely known or consistently followed. Recent health systems changes, including new Medicare reimbursement mechanisms and uptake of electronic medical records (EMRs), present opportunities to improve post-diagnosis care for dementia in busy primary care settings. The proposal leverages these opportunities to address the complex challenges of clinical practice transformation and linking diagnosis to timely, high quality dementia care. Aims 1 and 2 use a mixed methods approach (primary care provider and multidisciplinary staff surveys and interviews, patient and family interviews) to understand barriers and facilitators to post-diagnosis dementia care, key stakeholder perspectives on essential components and strategies for dementia care, and perceived feasibility of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary post-diagnosis dementia care intervention. Results will inform the adaptation of an intervention centered around a structured post-diagnosis dementia care visit in primary care in Aim 3. Implementation will leverage EMRs and Medicare reimbursement for dementia care to bring dementia-related assessment and support tools to primary care. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in one primary care clinic, laying the groundwork for a future multisite pragmatic randomized controlled trial to assess intervention effectiveness in improving quality of care and patient outcomes. The proposal addresses a significant challenge (dementia care) in an important setting (primary care).

5R01NS117761-05,Birth Tissue Products for Non-opioid Treatment of Post-surgical Pain,"PROJECT SUMMARY Post-surgical pain causes significant suffering to patients and an over-reliance on opioids for pain reduction. However, opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and a risk of accidental death from overdose. Unfortunately, effective non-opioid pain therapy remains lacking. We aim to determine if human cell and tissue product (HCT/P), such as amniotic membrane and umbilical cord, can be developed for use as a novel and safe treatment of post-surgical pain. In Aim 1, we will first prove the concept by demonstrating the efficacy, receptor mechanisms, and safety of HCT/P for inhibiting post-surgical pain in murine models. Our preliminary studies showed that intraoperative treatment with HCT/P reduced the development of post-surgical pain in rats. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that HCT/P targets immune cells as an indirect mode of anti-pain action. We hypothesize that HCT/P promotes regenerative wound healing by suppressing immune cell recruitment and inducing anti-inflammatory effects. Our recent studies suggested that the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid-pentraxin 3 complex (HC-HA/PTX3) is a biologically active component uniquely present in HCT/P. We will further explore how HC-HA/PTX3 polarizes macrophages differentiated from human THP-1 cells to an M2 phenotype and whether HC-HA/PTX3 inhibits the activation of human LAD2 mast cell and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In Aim 3, we will examine the targeting of primary sensory neurons as the direct mode of anti-pain action by HCT/P and HC-HA/PTX3. We will test whether HC-HA/PTX3 reduces intrinsic membrane excitability and inhibits membrane ion channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Furthermore, we will investigate whether the neuronal inhibition by HC-HA/PTX3 involves a novel mechanism that depends on CD44-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement. To achieve these goals, we will combine the expertise of preclinical and translational pain researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the GMP manufacturing of HCT/P at TissueTech, Inc. This study will provide important rationales for developing HCT/P-based bioceuticals as a viable non-opioid treatment of post-surgical pain. Such drugs will act not only directly, by dampening neuronal excitation, but also indirectly, by changing the wound environment and orchestrating regenerative healing. Through the complementary dual mode of action, we envision that birth HCT/P may lead to an optimal therapeutic effect with lasting pain relief and a potential “cure” of post-surgical pain.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2549,367,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5F30AG084193-02,The role of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in circuit remodeling in the mature brain,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition affecting approximately 6.7 million people in the US aged 65 and older. Individuals with AD experience progressive memory loss and profound atrophy of the hippocampus, the seat of learning and memory in the central nervous system (CNS). Currently there is no cure for AD, and the percentage of affected US citizens is predicted to grow given our steadily aging population. Although neuronal death is prominent in AD, non-neuronal glial cells have been shown to be key players in AD pathogenesis, as they influence the microenvironment, provide metabolic support, and control inflammation. Nevertheless, the precise roles of different glial cell types in hippocampal aging and AD disease progression remain to be defined. Recent evidence indicates that a ubiquitous population of glial progenitor cells, termed oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) or NG2+ glia, control the extracellular matrix, engulf neuronal processes and present antigen through major histocompatibility complex I and II, and exhibit reactive behavior in disease, suggesting that they may modify the integration and survival of neurons in the brain. Although OPCs give rise to oligodendrocytes in the developing and adult CNS, they persist throughout life and may play important non-progenitor roles. Importantly, transcriptional analysis of OPCs indicate that they take on a unique molecular signature in AD; however, we have only a limited understanding of the impact of OPCs on neural circuit remodeling. An understanding of the mechanisms governing their role in promoting the integration and survival of neurons could reveal their unique role in neurodegeneration. To study the role of OPCs in circuit remodeling in the healthy and diseased brain, I plan to define the role of OPCs in two regions of neuronal integration that persist into adulthood: the stratum lucidum (SL) of the hippocampus (a key site of AD pathogenesis) and the olfactory bulb (OB). My preliminary analyses reveal that OPCs are denser and exhibit a unique morphology and transcriptional profile within the SL, where newly born dentate gyrus granule cells project their axons to area CA3, and within the OB, where neurons arriving from the rostral migratory stream integrate. These findings provide the motivation to explore the distinct features of OPCs in these regions and their involvement in circuit reorganization. I will test the central hypothesis that OPCs facilitate the integration of newly born neurons in the adult CNS and alter neuronal survival in AD. I will define the phenotype of OPCs in areas of active neuronal remodeling through in vivo imaging and scRNA-Seq; I will quantify the role of OPCs in circuit remodeling across aging, exercise, and neurodegeneration (specifically an AD mouse model); and I will genetically manipulate OPCs and determine the effect these manipulations have on neuronal integration. Through these studies, I hope to define the role of OPC-neuron interactions in structural remodeling of neurons in the mature CNS. Understanding the role of OPCs in the development and maintenance of neuronal connectivity could have important implications for brain development, repair, and survival of hippocampal neurons in AD.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3278,498,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R01MH138270-01,HomeLink2: Reducing posthospitalization mortality among people living with HIV through structured home care and nutritional supplementation,"PROJECT SUMMARY HIV remains the leading cause of death among adults in South Africa despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to failure to initiate ART and failure to remain on ART. Among people living with HIV (PLWH) who are hospitalized, 17-26% die within 6 months of hospital discharge potentially contributing to more than half of all HIV-associated mortality in South Africa. There are heterogenous reasons for mortality that include missed diagnoses, psychosocial barriers to completing treatment plans, and structural barriers that include food insecurity. To respond to the complexity of underlying causes of mortality we developed and piloted a disease neutral intervention to reduce posthospitalization mortality: HomeLink. This intervention consisted of structured posthospitalization home care visits with psychosocial counselling and nutritional supplementation and reduced posthospitalization mortality by 60%. These results raise important questions regarding reproducibility and scale-up of this intervention. In order to inform policy, the most feasible and cost- effective elements need to be identified. Here we are proposing a fully powered study of a refined HomeLink2 intervention to compare usual care to structured home visits or home visits plus nutritional supplementation. In addition, we will identify underlying mechanisms of the intervention effectiveness including the impact on timeliness of acute care, medical diagnoses, adherence to ART (through viral load testing), and psychosocial metrics. We will further assess implementation outcomes to guide future refinement of intervention delivery. Finally, we will use findings from the randomized trial to complete costing and cost-effectiveness analyses to inform policy makers regarding cost of HomeLink2 and cost-effectiveness of home visits alone or home visits plus nutritional support to inform potential scale-up and long-term sustainability. This project has the potential to generate considerable new knowledge on interventions that could dramatically reduce HIV-associated mortality in South Africa and other low- and middle-income settings. This proposed study is very likely to generate actionable knowledge to improve outcomes for PLWH and contribute to overall goals of HIV epidemic control.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2306,322,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01EB034272-02,Mesoscopic microscopy for ultra-high speed and large-scale volumetric brain imaging,"PROJECT SUMMARY The brain is built on billions of neural connections in a highly organized 3D hierarchy. At the same time, neural activity is highly dynamics that requires kilohertz imaging rate to capture action potentials and sub-threshold voltage signals, the fundamental bit for neural communication. While the recent advent of genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) makes it possible to optically record the neural membrane voltage, the technical challenges are profound in imaging millimeter-scale volumetric voltage imaging at kilohertz with cellular resolution. In this proposal, we aim to address the challenges by developing a one-photon mesoscopic (i.e. millimeter scale field of view, FOV) volumetric voltage imaging, using mesoscopic oblique plane microscopy (Meso-OPM). Our technique will image >1.8 mm2 FOV, >0.1 mm depth penetration at 1 KHz, capable of recording voltage signals across an entire nervous system of a Zebrafish larva. The bright and stable GEVIs Voltron with JF525 dye will be used in our proposed work. Meso-OPM is a variant of light sheet microscopy (LSM), with a single primary objective lens instead of two in conventional LSM. The simplified optical design allows 1) leveraging high photon efficiency in LSM; 2) integrating ultra-fast passive optical scanning to achieve >1 MHz frame rate; and 3) flexible optical designs for millimeter FOV and cellular resolution. In addition to the technical challenges for large-scale ultrafast 3D imaging, the effective data processing pipeline for massive data is also highly desirable. To this end, we propose a robust and efficient deep learning framework to perform self- supervised 4D denoising and neuron segmentation. The pipeline enable massive data processing at 10 volume per second for the downstream neuroscience studies. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of proposed techniques, we will image Zebrafish in response to optic flow by a drifting grating visual stimuli. We will identify neural circuitry responsible to the motion compensation to the optic flow (i.e. maintaining body position when presented drifting grating) from eyes all the way to spinal cord.

We recently discovered that the enzyme Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) to glutamate, is highly upregulated in activated macrophages infiltrating muscle during aging, and that inhibiting the elevated GCPII activity with the inhibitor 2-PMPA (IC50 = 0.3nM) dramatically delays neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation, and muscle function and volume loss. Unfortunately, 2-PMPA is not clinically developable. It is highly polar, with negligible oral bioavailability (F<2%), a short half-life (<30m), and is active only with high systemic (IP) doses. Given its significant clinical potential, we propose to address these limitations by utilizing hydroxyl-dendrimers to facilitate its sustained and targeted delivery. Hydroxyl-dendrimers have shown promise as targeted delivery systems due to their size (~4-10 nm) and surface attributes. They are rapidly cleared from circulation under normal conditions but are selectively engulfed and retained by activated and phagocytic immune cells under injury or inflammatory conditions. This is a very translational approach, as targeted dendrimer delivery has been demonstrated to be efficacious in multiple animal models and recently shown to reduce inflammation and mortality in a Ph2 clinical trial in hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 (NCT04458298). We have assembled a highly experienced team with extensive expertise in neuromuscular disorders and aging (Hoke), dendrimer nanoparticles (Kannan), and animal pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical translation (Slusher). Together we plan to develop dendrimer-2PMPA (D-2PMPA) for age-related sarcopenia by implementing the following aims: AIM 1. Synthesize and characterize generation 4 (G4) and generation 6 (G6) D-2PMPA conjugates. AIM 2. Assess D-2PMPA (G4 and G6) pharmacokinetics, target engagement, and biodistribution in aged mice. AIM 3. Evaluate the efficacy (behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological) and tolerability of the selected D-2PMPA conjugate in aged mice. Successful execution of these aims will result in a D-2PMPA conjugate ready for IND-enabling studies to support future clinical studies to combat age-related sarcopenia.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2446,339,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01HD104673-03,Safety of Combinatorial Therapy with Erythropoietin and Melatonin for Preterm Infants with Intraventricular Hemorrhage,"Very preterm infants are prone to numerous medical complications with lifelong impact. Amongst the most serious are severe intraventricular hemorrhage (sIVH) and the subsequent progression to posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH). Currently, the only treatment for PHH is surgery, most commonly with shunts that are prone to malfunction across the lifespan. Children with sIVH and PHH are also at high risk for intellectual disability, behavioral problems, neurosensory impairment, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Emerging evidence suggests that the cellular and molecular events regulating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, including CSF secretion, propulsion and reabsorption, develop during the third trimester and the first few months postnatally. Maturation of these highly subspecialized and metabolically active cellular processes spatially and temporally overlaps with preterm birth and IVH, and are thus vulnerable to injury over an extended period. Most importantly, these processes are responsive to neurorestorative interventions with re-purposed medications, raising the possibility of using medical treatment after sIVH to prevent progression to PHH and the need for shunts. Preclinical data show that melatonin (MLT) and erythropoietin (EPO), when administered in a sustained dosing regimen, can prevent the hallmarks of progression from early postnatal sIVH to subsequent PHH, including macrocephaly and ventriculomegaly. Combination therapy is required as neither agent alone prevents PHH. In human preterm infants, MLT and EPO have been safely used as monotherapy in clinical trials with similar dosing regimens. We propose a Phase I, single institution, randomized, double-blind trial for very preterm infants with sIVH to define a safe combination dose of MLT and EPO. With IRB, IND and primary neonatologist approval, and informed consent, a maximum of 60 very preterm neonates with sIVH will be enrolled, treated through 33w6/7d, and followed to 37w6/7d. Neonates will be randomized 3:1 between MLT+EPO and placebo, with all receiving standard of care. Concurrent controls are needed due to fluctuations in preterm birth co-morbidities and mortality. Masking is essential to reduce attribution bias. The primary endpoint is a composite serious adverse event (SAE)/dose limiting toxicity (DLT) including death, potential MLT-realted DLT: severe liver function abnormalities compared to age-matched peers with sIVH, and known EPO-related SAE: thrombosis, polycythemia, and hypertension. No MLT-related SAE have emerged in clinical trials thus far. We hypothesize that the MLT+EPO SAE/DLT rate will not be higher than the placebo rate. Secondary outcomes will be rate of co-morbidities of preterm birth. Exploratory data, collected to guide design of future clinical trials for efficacy, will include serial neuro-imaging metrics acquired from clinical images, serial neonatal neurodevelopmental examinations, serum and urine MLT and EPO levels, and liquid biomarkers. Successful implementation of this initial safety trial will provide essential data to guide the next stage of clinical trials to test if sustained MLT+EPO treatment can reduce the need for surgical intervention, and avoid the lifelong burden of shunted hydrocephalus.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3252,460,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01EY016151-18,Inflammatory cells of choroid: a therapeutic target in AMD,"The cause of geographic atrophy (GA), a progressive dry form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is elusive and there is currently no therapy for this blinding disorder. Our prior studies have demonstrated that RPE death is accompanied by attenuation of choriocapillaris (CC). Like other tissues in the aging body, the choroid is undergoing low grade chronic inflammation, termed inflammaging. This is logical because, in the GA choroid, there is elevated complement C3a and 5a, as well as advanced glycosylation end products, and C- reactive protein (CRP). CRP is an acute phase reactant and an active regulator of the innate immune system that has been suggested by some to be a risk factor for AMD. There are also two resident inflammatory cells in choroid, mast cells (MCs) and macrophages. We have previously demonstrated that macrophages are activated in GA and MC numbers and the number of degranulated MCs are increased in GA choroid. Our recent study demonstrated that simply degranulating MCs with slow-released 48/80 (a snake-venom like compound) causes a GA-like phenotype: degeneration of RPE, visual function decline, and thinning of retina and choroid. In a pilot study, we observed that slow- released subconjunctival CRP stimulated MC degranulation in rat choroid and RPE degeneration. In the proposed studies, we investigate the effect of CRP at a physiologically relevant level on the RPE/Bruchs membrane/CC complex in vitro and in our in vivo rat model. The proposed studies will determine if CRP, which is greatly elevated in AMD choroid, acts directly on RPE or whether its effect is via activation of macrophages and/or mast cells. All three cells express Fcγ receptors, which are some of CRP binding sites. If MC degranulation is the cause of RPE degeneration, we will determine if MC granules or exosomes are responsible. The RPE migration at the border of GA atrophy is presumed to be epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT) but this has not been characterized and the cause of this event is unknown. We will first determine if this is EMT in human GA and in our rat model. Then we will investigate in vitro if CRP stimulates EMT directly or if CRP-induced MC degranulation is the cause. Our results will provide new opportunities for understanding GA pathology and determine the role that choroidal CRP plays in GA. Our studies also have the potential of identifying novel therapies for GA by quiescing MCs or by preventing CRP from binding its FCγ receptors.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2495,405,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5U24DC020850-03,Johns Hopkins Human Temporal Bone Resource,"Project Summary Temporal bone research is essential for refining our understanding of the mechanisms of otologic disease; however, the difficulty in accessing this tissue, the typically long processing times, and the expense have contributed to a dwindling number of labs engaged in this work. In the 1920s, the first human temporal bone laboratory in the U.S. was established at Johns Hopkins. The collection contains approximately ~1400 processed specimens from donors with a range of otologic diseases that were obtained primarily in the 1920s through 1970s, but only a handful of studies have made use of this collection in the past 20 years. We propose to make the collection more accessible to the scientific community and to re-establish the infrastructure for harvesting, imaging, and processing new specimens with the intention of recruiting new donors from population-based studies of aging in which participants have already consented to autopsies and brain donations being performed at Johns Hopkins, as well as other clinical otological studies ongoing in the Baltimore Metro Region. We will partner with faculty specializing in biological visualization, bilingual scientific communication, and mentoring diverse scientists to develop inclusive outreach tools. We will also partner with Baltimore-based transcriptomics resources to establish protocols for performing spatial transcriptomics analysis in nonhuman primate and human temporal bones. We will approach these objectives with three Specific Aims: 1) Catalog, prioritize, and digitize existing specimens from the Johns Hopkins Human Temporal Bone Collection; 2) Develop efficient harvesting, rapid histology, and spatial transcriptomics workflows for new specimens and establish partnerships for collecting specimens during autopsies performed on participants in epidemiological studies; 3) Education/outreach activities to encourage other investigators to engage in temporal bone research. The large temporal bone collection and the inner ear illustrations of Max Brödel at Johns Hopkins contributed greatly to our early understanding of many diseases of the ear, such as the discovery of glomus bodies, the histopathologic correlates of presbycusis, and innervation of the saccular maculae. The collection has also shown enduring value, contributing to our understanding of the prevalence of a dehiscent superior semicircular canal and arachnoid granulations as well as the role of melanin in cochlear and vestibular protection. Sharing this valuable collection with other researchers while applying novel techniques in digital processing and education will accelerate advances in and knowledge of otopathology. We look forward to reinvigorating this tradition of excellence by developing a new collection, applying modern techniques, and integrating otopathology with population-based studies that include comprehensive otologic testing and functional measures.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2935,411,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1F31CA284525-01A1,Investigation of Immunotherapy-induced Alterations to Cellular Communication Networks in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,"PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest forms of cancer in the United States. The low mutational burden in PDAC leads to low infiltration of T cells that could become cytotoxic to cancer cells by administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Neoantigen vaccines promote T cell invasion, but do not protect T cells from exhaustion. Analysis of immunotherapy approaches to clinical treatment of PDAC combining cancer vaccines with ICIs suggests that efficacious immune response involves alterations in cell-cell communication among tumor-invading immune cells. Murine models of neoantigen response indicate that simultaneous priming of tumor-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells increases survival through CD4+ T cell-dependent enhancement of anti-tumor CD8+ T cell and myeloid cell functions. I hypothesize that effective immunotherapy response in PDAC is dependent on altering cellular signaling networks in the tumor microenvironment to maintain durable cytotoxic effector states and hinder immunosuppressive signals. To test this hypothesis, I will utilize single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from a compiled atlas of immunotherapy-naïve PDAC, primary tumors from a neoadjuvant trial of combination immunotherapy for PDAC, and a murine model of personalized neoantigen vaccine treatment for PDAC. Experiments posed in Aim 1 will develop statistical methods for the utilization of the cellular communication inference tool Domino in identifying cellular interactions that differentially occur between treatment groups in scRNA-seq data from clinical trials of combination immunotherapy in humans. Experiments posed in Aim 2 will identify the mechanism by which the tumor-specific T cells expanded by the neoantigen vaccine PancVAX2 attack liver metastases in an orthotopic murine model of PDAC through flow cytometry and inference of cell- cell communication in scRNA-seq data. Collectively, these experiments will inform mechanistic understanding of how combination immunotherapies enhance immune responses to PDAC through enhancement of T cell cytotoxicity and alterations of communication between immune cells. This proposed work will have broad applications improving immunotherapy approaches to the treatment of PDAC and develop computational tools for scRNA-seq analysis to assess how cellular communication is altered by outside perturbations and sample features.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2422,336,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5K24AI143447-04,Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo.

5R01EB028259-03,Multi-voxel spectral editing at 3T,"PROJECT SUMMARY Edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows the non-invasive detection of low-concentration metabolites within the brain, free from overlap from other, more abundant compounds. Until recently, spectral- editing techniques have generally focused on measuring individual metabolites in one brain region at a time (for instance, the well-known ‘MEGA-PRESS’ method). However, this is a time-consuming approach which severely limits clinical applicability when multiple metabolites and/or brain regions are involved. The main goal of this proposal is therefore to develop and establish the reproducibility edited experiments that can detect multiple edited molecules in multiple brain regions, all within a single acquisition. We will develop multi-voxel localization techniques to combine with our recently developed multi-metabolite editing methods, including the Hadamard-encoded ‘HERMES’ approach as well as the new ‘HERCULES’ method which allows for up to 13 metabolites to be simultaneously determined. For applications that may require a limited number of voxels to be acquired, we will developed multi-band excitation and parallel acquisition ‘PRIAM’ methods in combination with HERMES and HERCULES. For applications that require greater spatial coverage and/or the ability to map out the spatial distribution of metabolite levels, edited MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) techniques will be developed for use in combination with HERMES and HERCULES editing. Since edited-MRSI is very sensitive to head motion and other instabilities, acquisition and processing methods will be implemented for robust, motion-insensitive edited-MRSI. Rigor and reproducibility will be carefully assessed; newly developed methodologies will be validated by comparison to conventional measurements in the same subjects. Expected improvements in temporal signal- to-noise ratios and reproducibility will also be measured. The resulting data acquisition and analysis tools will be made available for dissemination to the clinical neuroscience and neuroimaging communities.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2070,280,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5F32DA054767-02,Mesostriatal dopamine in Pavlovian reward rate learning,"PROJECT SUMMARY Dopamine (DA) signaling in the ventral striatum has received considerable attention for its role in relapse and drug craving, both in rodent models of addiction and in humans. A popular belief is that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) communicate a prediction error to the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), where the error reports the difference between observed and expected values of cues and rewards. A critical assumption is that prediction errors are based on values, and this idea has been used to explain how drugs of abuse exert their reinforcing effects by hijacking DA-mediated value learning. However, in most studies that measure DA cell activity and neurotransmitter release, value is confounded with another variable critical for learning: mutual information, or the degree to which cues in the environment signal relative changes in reward rate. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to investigate the extent to which an information-theoretic account of learning can be captured by mesostriatal DA dynamics. Behavioral manipulations will utilize established methods of inducing changes in mutual information between cues and rewards independent of value during Pavlovian conditioning in rats. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will use fiber photometry to assess whether bulk activity in VTA DA neurons and DA release in the NAcc encode prediction errors based on mutual information, and whether cue-evoked responses in NAcc neurons scales with mutual information. Aim 2 will determine whether conditioned behavior will diminish when degrading mutual information between cues and optogenetic DA stimulation in either VTA cell bodies or VTA axon terminals in the NAcc. Experiments in Aim 3 will assess whether optogenetically inhibiting VTA DA neurons that project to the NAcc during moments of Pavlovian information loss will rescue conditioned behavior from dissipating, and whether stimulating cue- sensitive ensembles of NAcc neurons at the onset of information-degraded cues will also have the same effect.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2063,311,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

The best-validated therapeutic target in HD remains Htt itself, and RNAi approaches are under development to lower mutant Htt in HD patients. However, these approaches have daunting obstacles of delivery large molecules to the CNS. Small molecule therapeutics remains an important alternative. We have identified near 40 PTMs (phosphorylation and acetylation) on endogenous Htt from human and mouse brain using quantitative proteomics. We find that the PTMs are arranged in clusters, and we have initial evidence for crosstalk among certain sites in these clusters.. Furthermore, we find that alteration of the residues for several of the PTMs abrogates mutant Htt neuronal toxicity, showing that PTMs are modulators of mutant Htt toxicity. These data indicate that identification of the enzymes catalyzing these PTMs will have potential for yielding defined molecular targets for disease-modifying therapy for HD. We now propose the next series of steps in these studies, in order to identify additional PTMs, and to identify enzymes that catalyze modifications, as potential defined molecular targets for rational therapeutics for HD. We will take advantage now of our newly developed HD iPSC-derived immortalized striatal precursor cell lines. In Aim 1, we will identify novel PTMs on Htt using our novel striatal precursor cell lines (SPNs) derived from HD iPS cells. These can be differentiated into neurons with a medium-spiny neuron phenotype. We will generate PTM-specific antibodies to high-priority PTMs, in order to evaluate localization in cellular compartments using immunofluorescence, and cell fractionation followed by Western blot, in SPNs and human brain.

5R01EB029341-04,Biomimetic Matrix for Ex Vivo and In Vivo Activation of T Cells,"PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this study is to engineer an artificial T cell-stimulating matrix (aTM) that presents antigen-specific and cell-specific biochemical and biophysical cues to control phenotype and improve functional profiles of T cells in a biomimetic context that captures key biochemical and biophysical features of the lymph node (LN). LN provides the critical microenvironment that orchestrates the presentation format and dynamics of the antigen-specific signals in a precise and controlled manner that leads to T cell activation, expansion, and maturation. Currently available T cell stimulating matrices while carrying the antigen-presentation complexes and co-stimulating cues, however, lacks adequate supporting cues inherent to the T cell stimulating microenvironment in the LN. We will design and characterize an aTM that integrates the three key T-cell stimulating signals: antigen-specific (Signal 1), co-stimulatory (Signal 2), and cytokines (Signal 3), together with extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and tunable biophysical properties inspired by the properties of both antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and the LN. We will test the hypothesis that co-presenting the APC signal cues in such a biomimetic context during T cell stimulation will result in functional T cells with controlled phenotypic profiles and potency. and mechanism revealing how all signaling cues synergize to active and polarize T cells. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine key matrix properties of the aTM that mediate robust CD8+ T cell activation using aTMs prepared from hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel and HA-nanofiber composite (NHC) matrix. In Specific Aim 2, we will define optimal signaling cues and their presentation configuration that influence CD4+ T cell activation and polarization on aTM; and demonstrate persistence and functions of aTM-stimulated and adoptively transferred antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. In Specific Aim 3, we will use aTM microparticles to co-stimulate CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and evaluate therapeutic benefits of a combination treatment with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a cancer immunotherapy mouse model. If successful, this study will result in the first set of engineered aTM that delivers robust stimulation of antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that promise improved therapeutic outcomes; and further enrich our understandings of design principles and mechanism of signaling cues in stimulation, polarization, and activation of T cells.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2480,361,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.

5K99HL150594-04,ADAMTS13 and Late Neurologic Morbidity after Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,"Acquired autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by acute episodes of systemic microvascular thrombosis caused by deficiency of ADAMTS13, a von Willebrand factor cleaving protease. TTP is more common in women and African Americans. Plasma exchange has improved survival of acute TTP from <10% to 80-90%; however, long-term adverse health outcomes in adults following recovery from TTP are under recognized. Recent data indicate that TTP survivors have higher mortality than age and sex matched controls and over 60% of TTP survivors demonstrate neurocognitive impairment. In a cohort of 157 TTP survivors at Johns Hopkins Hospital, we found a high rate of incident stroke unrelated to an acute TTP relapse during long-term follow up.Intriguingly, over 50% of TTP survivors did not recover ADAMTS13 activity in remission and low ADAMTS13 activity in remission was associated with a higher risk of stroke. Silent cerebral infarcts are ischemic lesions seen on MRI in patients without neurologic symptoms, which are associated with future stroke and cognitive impairment in the general population. Currently, there are no published studies evaluating the prevalence of silent infarcts in TTP survivors, and their association with future stroke and cognitive impairment. The association of ADAMTS13 in remission with ischemic cerebral events (silent infarct and stroke) is also unknown. Dr. Chaturvedi has established a large prospective cohort of patients with TTP, generated compelling preliminary data regarding the risk of stroke in TTP survivors, and established collaborations throughout Johns Hopkins Hospital to answer these questions. We will use the existing Johns Hopkins Thrombotic Microangiopathy Registry to test the hypothesis that silent cerebral infarcts more common in TTP survivors than an age and sex-matched control population, and are a risk factor for stroke and cognitive impairment (Aim 1). We will evaluate whether low ADAMTS13 activity during TTP remission is associated with cerebral ischemic events (silent infarcts and stroke) (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate the association of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and germline variants in ADAMTS13 and complement genes with silent infarcts and stroke (Aim 3). Understanding the epidemiology and risk factors for cerebrovascular and cognitive sequelae of TTP will lead to a pilot study of an intervention (low dose anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy) to reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts and stroke in high-risk TTP patients and has implications for understanding the role of ADAMTS13 in cerebrovascular disease in other populations.

5K23DA055693-02,Harmonizing Multiple Data Sources And Psychological Autopsy To Characterize Suicides Among Opioid-Related Deaths,"Project Summary/ Abstract This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the applicant with the advanced training necessary to establish an independent program of research in the epidemiology of overdose mortality and suicide. A comprehensive training program is proposed, combining formal coursework, mentoring, and hands-on training experiences designed to develop expertise in data linkage/ harmonization, latent class modeling (LCA), qualitative psychological autopsy (PA) and mixed methods research. As overdose deaths increase, they continue to be treated as accidents resulting from changes in opioid use. However, epidemiologic research suggests that many of these deaths are likely suicides, This has important implications for appropriately targeting interventions. We will measure the magnitude of this misclassification of manner of death (MOD; intentionality) and identify factors that may guide medical examiners to more accurately classify suicide decedents. We hypothesize that approximately one third of opioid related deaths of undetermined manner are truly suicides, and that LCA can distinguish subgroups of decedents with greater likelihood of suicidal intent. We will use PA in a subset of previously undetermined intent decedents to test predictive ability of empirically-derived classes and characterize the diverse paths to overdose. We propose to analyze all opioid overdose deaths in Maryland from 2006-2019 (n=13,861) using demographic, social, and clinical data which we will link from the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse to mortality data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). First, taking one third of this sample, we will compare cases classified as suicidal (n=115) from accidental (n=756) and undetermined intent (n=3,748) using a three-way multinomial logistic regression. Next, variables found to be most salient comparators will be used in LCA of the remaining cases, agnostic of OCME MOD class (n=9,286). Comparing the empirically derived classes with the OCME designations, we will assess the proportion of designated suicides and accidents in each class. Finally, from each of these latent classes, we will select 40 decedents designated by OCME as ‘undetermined manner’ to be further examined by multiple collateral interview PA, to corroborate these latent classes. By generalizing findings from LCA and PA, more accurate suicide rate estimates can be made. Findings would impact future MOD designation and potentially, how prevention interventions target accidental overdoses and suicides.

5R21AI163569-02,Mapping the antibody response to Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein,"PROJECT SUMMARY Trypanosoma brucei is a causative agent of human and animal African trypanosomiasis, devastating diseases that endanger public health and present a major barrier to economic development in sub-Saharan Africa. The extracellular parasite manages to sustain an infection in the blood and tissues of its mammalian host by periodically “switching” its dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat. Drawing from a genomic repertoire of ~2000 VSG-encoding genes, the parasite changes its expressed VSG coat throughout infection. Before the host antibody response can clear a population expressing one VSG, the parasite switches expression to a new VSG, rendering it invisible to host antibody for a time. This process occurs continually and allows the parasite to maintain a chronic infection. The interaction between antibody and VSG, therefore, represents a critical interface in this infection. Despite its importance, the principles governing antibody recognition of VSG remain poorly understood. Here we propose to investigate the antibody-VSG interface during infection in high resolution using a high-throughput epitope mapping approach called phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq). Using a phage display library containing peptides from every VSG ever annotated, we will measure antibody responses to VSG during chronic infections, while simultaneously using a high-throughput sequencing method developed by our lab to track the VSGs expressed during infection. In the first aim, we will characterize the dynamics and targets of anti-VSG antibody during chronic experimental infections. In the second aim, we will use PhIP-seq to map VSG epitopes in natural human infections. The proposed study will further our understanding of anti-VSG antibody responses while establishing T. brucei as a tractable model for the study of antibody responses to antigenically variable pathogens. Long term, this work could inform strategies for diagnosis or prevention of an important neglected tropical disease.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2024,289,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01EY016151-17,Inflammatory cells of choroid: a therapeutic target in AMD,"The cause of geographic atrophy (GA), a progressive dry form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is elusive and there is currently no therapy for this blinding disorder. Our prior studies have demonstrated that RPE death is accompanied by attenuation of choriocapillaris (CC). Like other tissues in the aging body, the choroid is undergoing low grade chronic inflammation, termed inflammaging. This is logical because, in the GA choroid, there is elevated complement C3a and 5a, as well as advanced glycosylation end products, and C- reactive protein (CRP). CRP is an acute phase reactant and an active regulator of the innate immune system that has been suggested by some to be a risk factor for AMD. There are also two resident inflammatory cells in choroid, mast cells (MCs) and macrophages. We have previously demonstrated that macrophages are activated in GA and MC numbers and the number of degranulated MCs are increased in GA choroid. Our recent study demonstrated that simply degranulating MCs with slow-released 48/80 (a snake-venom like compound) causes a GA-like phenotype: degeneration of RPE, visual function decline, and thinning of retina and choroid. In a pilot study, we observed that slow- released subconjunctival CRP stimulated MC degranulation in rat choroid and RPE degeneration. In the proposed studies, we investigate the effect of CRP at a physiologically relevant level on the RPE/Bruchs membrane/CC complex in vitro and in our in vivo rat model. The proposed studies will determine if CRP, which is greatly elevated in AMD choroid, acts directly on RPE or whether its effect is via activation of macrophages and/or mast cells. All three cells express Fcγ receptors, which are some of CRP binding sites. If MC degranulation is the cause of RPE degeneration, we will determine if MC granules or exosomes are responsible. The RPE migration at the border of GA atrophy is presumed to be epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT) but this has not been characterized and the cause of this event is unknown. We will first determine if this is EMT in human GA and in our rat model. Then we will investigate in vitro if CRP stimulates EMT directly or if CRP-induced MC degranulation is the cause. Our results will provide new opportunities for understanding GA pathology and determine the role that choroidal CRP plays in GA. Our studies also have the potential of identifying novel therapies for GA by quiescing MCs or by preventing CRP from binding its FCγ receptors.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2495,405,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5R01NS107318-05,Understanding the Mechanism of Pathological alpha-Synuclein Transmission,"α-Synucleinopathies are a subset of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) (1), which are characterized by abnormal accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) protein in neurons or glial cells. Emerging evidence suggests that the cell-to-cell transmission of pathological α-syn substantially cause neurodegeneration. However, the molecular mechanism of α-syn transmission is poorly understood. We have identified three transmembrane proteins that strongly bind with α-syn PFF: (i) lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG3), (ii) amyloid β precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1), and (iii) neurexin 1-β. LAG3 is an essential receptor, mediating internalization of α-syn PFF; however, substantial α-syn PFF binds to LAG3-/- (knockout) neurons, suggesting that a unidentified candidate(s) (e.g. APLP1) binds with pathologic α-syn, and facilitate the internalization. In this proposal, we hypothesize: (i) APLP1 is an essential receptor, that mediates α-syn transmission; (ii) APLP1-LAG3 complex synergistically mediates α-syn transmission; (iii) depletion of APLP1, LAG3, or APLP1- LAG3 complex, can reduce α-syn-induced neurodegeneration of α-syn transgenic mice. Accordingly, experiments are proposed to characterize the roles of APLP1, LAG3 and the AL complex in mediating the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies, in cell-to-cell transmission models and the α-syn transgenic mouse model. Experiments in two mice models with α-synucleinopathies, will be complemented by studies in cells and cell-free experiments, thus allowing the deciphering of each spreading step in the interaction of APLP1, LAG3, or the AL complex with pathologic α-syn. The successful completion of these studies will greatly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of α-syn cell-to-cell transmission via receptors, by: (i) identifying APLP1 as a novel receptor that mediates α-syn spreading, (ii) understanding the synergistic effect of the AL complex on mediating binding and internalization of α-syn PFF, (iii) providing essential preliminary evaluation of anti-LAG3 antibody as a potential therapeutic agent against PD and related α-synucleinopathies, and (iv) understanding the roles of APLP1, LAG3, and the AL complex in mediating neurodegeneration of α-syn transgenic mice.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2348,318,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih

5F31NS129262-02,Neuromorphic encoding of tactile stimuli to provide naturalistic sensory feedback in upper limb prostheses,"PROJECT SUMMARY This research project is motivated by the goal of improving the lives of amputees through naturalistic sensory feedback of tactile stimuli. Today, prostheses rely on decoding user intention through measurement of neural or electromyographic (EMG) signals. The full potential of these sophisticated robotic devices cannot be realized without the incorporation of sensors that evaluate the environment and a way to seamlessly communicate with the user. Neural prostheses can enable this seamless communication by interfacing directly with the nervous system of amputees and stimulating the nerves in order to elicit sensations corresponding to the interaction between the prosthesis and the environment. To do this naturalistically, the analog readings from sensors incorporated into the prosthesis must be encoded into the language of the nervous system: patterns of spiking activity. My goal is to improve sensory feedback for amputees by exploring how information from tactile sensors can be transformed into neuron-like (neuromorphic) spikes to be used for stimulation feedback. I will examine how tactile sensing is encoded in biology and then phenomenologically recreate the signal processing chain using a computational model that will be tested with a real-world texture dataset. The output of these models will be classified to verify and quantify the successful encoding of texture information as neuromorphic spiking activity. Texture serves as a good test case to develop these models because of its rich spatiotemporal structure. Specific Aim 1 – Neuromorphic Encoding and Processing of Tactile Stimuli – I will use the Izhikevich neuron model to recreate the spiking activity of SA and RA mechanoreceptors in response to texture stimuli applied to a tactile sensing array. I will develop new algorithms to transform the spiking patterns to account for scanning speed and applied force. This will result in a speed- and force-invariant representation of texture. Specific Aim 2 – Neuromorphic Compression of Tactile Information – Initially, a naïve channel selection algorithm that uses spike train distance to evaluate mutual information between different input channels will compress tactile information to select an optimal set of sensing channels to pass through to stimulation. A more advanced scheme will combine inputs together for more efficient information encoding and to enrich the information content of the final output spiking patterns. Artificial texture classification will be used to evaluate the capability of these methods to efficiently retain relevant texture information. Fundamentally, Aim 1 focuses on robust representations of tactile stimuli independent of exploratory conditions, while Aim 2 focuses on efficient representations of those stimuli. When completed, this work will provide the basis for more naturalistic sensory feedback to amputees through peripheral nerve stimulation which will result in better functional outcomes when using prostheses in their daily lives.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3029,444,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R35NS132153-01,Ultrafast membrane trafficking at synapses,"Project Summary Neuronal signaling events at synapses determine circuit responses and result in specific behavioral outputs. This signaling is dynamic - modulated by the history of synaptic activity and perceived stimuli. Defects in neurotransmission also play a causative role in neurological disorders. However, our understanding of this process is limited by two factors: size and speed. Over the years, we have developed several techniques in electron microscopy to visualize changes in protein localization and synaptic ultrastructure associated with neuronal activity with millisecond temporal precision. Our experiments have revealed key insights into mechanisms of the synaptic vesicle cycle as well as new parameters controlling synaptic plasticity. However, many mysteries remain. How do exocytic and endocytic proteins coordinate to mediate membrane remodeling at synapses on a millisecond time scale? How do these proteins interact with each other and membrane lipids to perform their functions? How heterogenous are these processes? To address these questions, we will develop novel approaches in electron microscopy and leverage these tools to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,1246,174,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R03HD109442-01A1,The Role of Outpatient Diuretic Therapy in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,"PROJECT SUMMARY More than 300,000 infants are born prematurely in the U.S. each year, and of these, approximately 50,000 develop chronic respiratory disease due to their prematurity. The most common respiratory manifestation is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which affects alveolar, airway, and pulmonary vascular development. Limited data suggests that a substantial percentage of children with BPD will have long-term respiratory symptoms persisting into adult life with altered lung function trajectories. However, predicting the course of respiratory disease in children with BPD throughout the lifespan is currently difficult, compounded by the wide variation in outpatient management after initial hospital discharge. One of the most common types of medical management are diuretics. Theoretically, diuretics reduce interstitial fluid within the lungs, thus decreasing work of breathing. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the benefits/risks of diuretic use within the neonatal intensive care unit, and virtually no data or guidelines for the use of these medications outside of the hospital. In light of the ongoing controversy that broad use of long-term diuretics in preterm infants may or may not be beneficial in the inpatient setting, our goal is to use “real-world” data to assess whether the outpatient use of diuretics reduce acute and chronic respiratory morbidities in preterm infants and young children less than 2 years of age and whether they are associated with the side effect of impaired growth. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that the use of diuretics during the first 2 years of life will result in less acute care use (e.g., emergency department visits and hospital readmissions) and decreased chronic respiratory symptoms (e.g., activity limitations and difficulty breathing). In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the use of diuretics during the first year after initial NICU discharge will result in impairment of growth. These studies will help direct our understanding and guidance for the use of outpatient diuretic use in children with BPD.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2076,311,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
1R21EB033426-01A1,DL-based CT image formation with characterization and control of resolution and noise,"Deep learning (DL) based CT image formation methods have proliferated over the past few years. The existing approaches mostly follow the paradigm established in computer vision, and build a deep neural network (DNN) with standard modules that capture salient image features useful for computer vision tasks. These standard modules also work very well for CT images, placing DL-based CT image formation methods at the forefront of research and innovation. However, current DNNs are oblivious to the fact that CT images, unlike natural images, must be interpretable by a radiologist to make a diagnosis. CT image interpretation is affected by image features such as image resolution and noise variance-covariance, which are under exploited by the standard modules from computer vision. Consequently, current DL-based CT image formation has no direct characterization, let alone prospective control, of image resolution and noise variance-covariance. These properties can only be assessed after an image is generated, but resolution/noise has no direct influence during the image formation process. In this proposal, we challenge this established paradigm and propose an innovative DL framework named GradDNN to (1) characterize the resolution and noise properties of a DNN’s output during network training or parameter fine-tuning, and to (2) guide the image formation process so that the output has the desired resolution/noise properties. GradDNN (which stands for gradient + DNN) applies network linearization, i.e., gradient computation, to a mother DNN to extract local resolution and noise properties of the images generated by the mother, and make these properties available during network training and parameter fine tuning. The linearization method for analyzing nonlinear systems such as a DNN has never been attempted before. Conceptually, GradDNN associates a daughter module to any mother DNN for noise/resolution characterization, thereby making the resulting network CT-specific. We will develop GradDNN and demonstrate its capability in the context of two important clinical tasks: (1) mitigation of calcium blooming in coronary CT angiography, and (2) low contrast lesion detection in abdominal CT, both of which have high requirements on resolution and noise. Data for DL network training will be generated using digitally augmented patient data prospectively collected at two sites. Image quality comparison between the mother DNN alone and the mother+daughter duo, using a number of effective mother DNN architectures, will be carried out to demonstrate the additional gain of DL with joint resolution/noise learning. The comparison will use both digitally augmented patient data and real patient data to further establish robustness and generalizability. In this exploratory proposal, we focus on DL networks that perform image-to-image transformation. However, the learning framework using GradDNN is general and can be applied to DL networks that perform direct projection-to-image transformation. Successful completion of this proposal will generate strong preliminary data for a follow-up R01 that extends our results to such DL networks.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3161,461,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
5K23DK133690-02,Metabolic Effects of Circadian-Based Dinner Time,"Obesity and its metabolic complications are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Evidence is mounting that inappropriate timing of food intake contributes to obesity. Late eating is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, suggesting that circadian misalignment may be the mechanism underlying the adverse metabolic consequences of late eating. We hypothesize that meal timing in relation to the endogenous circadian rhythm, rather than to clock hour, determines metabolic outcomes. In this study, we will use dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), the gold-standard for ascertaining central circadian output, to assess individual circadian rhythms. We will use DLMO to prospectively assign “early” (DLMO-3h) vs “late” (DLMO+1h) dinner while maintaining the same sleep times (DLMO+2h to +10h) to evaluate whether acute metabolic dysfunction can be reliably induced or prevented by setting dinner times around DLMO. We will use hourly blood sampling for detailed glucose and insulin profiles, oral [2H31] palmitate tracer to quantify dietary fat oxidation, and whole-room indirect calorimetry to measure total fat oxidation. We will enroll both normal-weight healthy adults (NWH) and adults with obesity and prediabetes (OPD), as the latter population is particularly vulnerable to metabolic diseases and could derive immediate benefit from our findings. The specific aims are to: 1) Quantify the impact of DLMO-based “early” vs. “late” dinner time on post-prandial and overnight glucose and insulin levels in NWH and OPD adults, 2) Measure the impact of DLMO-based “early” vs. “late” dinner time on (a) exogenous/dietary and (b) total fat oxidation in NWH and OPD adults, and 3) Examine the utility of circadian phase markers to predict susceptibility to late eating-induced metabolic dysfunction. For Aims 1 and 2, we will crossover-randomize 16 NWH adults (8 men, 8 women) and 16 OPD adults (8 men, 8 women) to the 2 dinner times with isocaloric feeding in a metabolic chamber. For Aim 3, we will leverage validated circadian metrics derived from actigraphy and ingestible thermosensors to predict effects of late dinner. Dr. Daisy Duan’s long-term career goal is to become an independent clinician investigator leveraging novel mechanistic insights that underly the intersection between the circadian system and metabolism to design and validate interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity and its metabolic complications. She seeks a K23 mentored career development award to gain critical skills and experience in order to effectively lead an independently-funded research program. The goals during the award period include developing expertise in the design and implementation of in vivo metabolic studies and in the principles, practice, and analytical methods in sleep and circadian phenotyping techniques, through a combination of mentored research experience, focused coursework, hands-on learning in research methodology, participation in local and national conferences, grant writing, and leadership training and experience.

5R01AG062649-05,PLAN: Dementia Literacy Education and Navigation for Korean Elders with Probable Dementia and their Caregivers,"Despite a higher prevalence of dementia, ethnic minority elders in the U.S. are underdiagnosed and at greater risk of not receiving appropriate care than their white counterparts. Early detection of dementia allows for a transition to early dementia care for community-dwelling elderly that may delay or slow deterioration of cognitive functions and functional disabilities and enable families to adequately plan for the potential challenges of dementia caregiving. Currently, little is known about how to effectively identify undiagnosed individuals with probable dementia in community-based settings that serve diverse racial and ethnic minorities and how to transition them into the health care system for necessary diagnostic follow-up and care for dementia. This proposed research addresses the critical gaps by focusing on dementia assessments and follow-up in one of the fastest-growing ethnic minority populations—Korean Americans (KAs). Our collaborative, interdisciplinary research team has more than 10 years of community-based, participatory research experience in the KA community and has laid the groundwork for the current application. In particular, we have conducted the first community-based epidemiological study which estimated the prevalence of dementia among KA elders. Moreover, we successfully trained bilingual community health workers (CHWs) and obtained evidence to support the feasibility and efficacy of using CHWs to assess dementia in community- residing Korean elders and promote linkage to medical service for dementia among KA elders with probable dementia while improving caregiver psychological outcomes. To this end, the goals of our study are to identify community-residing Korean elderly with probable dementia and to test the effects of dementia literacy training and navigation assistance by CHWs to transition affected Korean elders and their caregivers into the healthcare system for adequate diagnostic follow-up and care. CHWs have been used to eliminate health disparities in resource-poor communities with positive outcomes. The adoption of trained CHWs for cognitive health is a new strategic approach which could be highly applicable to many linguistic and/or socially-isolated racial/ethnic minority communities with limited resources.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2285,320,1.0,False,False,0.09523809523809523,phase2_nih
5K23HL153781-04,The role of xanthine oxidoreductase activity and altered metabolism in scleroderma-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease of the pulmonary vasculature that leads to right heart failure and death. Patients with scleroderma (SSc) are at high risk for the development of PAH (SSc-PAH), which is a leading cause of death in SSc. While advances in PAH therapeutics have led to improved outcomes, survival in SSc-PAH remains dismal, with 57% of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Thus, there is an urgent need to expand therapeutic options in SSc-PAH, and to identify novel markers of disease risk and severity. PAH pathogenesis is highly complex, with simultaneous dysregulation of multiple biologic pathways, yet current therapies for PAH target just three pathways that regulate vasomotor tone. One potentially targetable metabolic regulator is the protein xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which metabolizes purines in an enzymatic reaction that generates uric acid and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative injury from over-abundant ROS drives endothelial cell dysfunction, altered metabolic signaling, and endothelial apoptosis, all early features of PAH pathobiology. XOR activity increases in experimental PH models, and XOR inhibition with allopurinol prevents pulmonary hypertensive changes from occurring. XOR activity is increased in PAH patients compared to healthy controls, and our preliminary data show that serum UA/XOR levels and purine metabolites significantly correlate with hemodynamics and predict outcomes in SSc-PAH patients. However, XOR has not been studied as a driver of disease and potential therapeutic target in SSc-PAH. We hypothesize that increased XOR activity contributes to PAH development in SSc and drives disease progression through oxidative injury and altered metabolism. By leveraging two rich data sources – the world's largest known SSc serum biorepository, and an NIH-sponsored prospective cohort of newly diagnosed SSc-PAH patients - we aim to 1) demonstrate that increased XOR activity and oxidative stress influence development of PAH in patients with scleroderma, 2) link XOR activity and oxidative stress with phenotypic and outcome data in SSc-PAH (with a special focus on right ventricular structural and functional phenotypes), and 3) identify metabolic patterns associated with poor clinical response to currently available PAH therapies. These aims will examine the role of XOR activity and oxidative stress in SSc-PAH in order to clarify the potential of XOR as a therapeutic target, and to lay a groundwork for personalized selection of PAH therapies in SSc.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2560,377,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
3R01DK128933-02S1,Regulators of adipocyte oxidative metabolism,"PROJECT SUMMARY Adipose oxidative metabolism is central to human health. Defects in adipocyte mitochondria are linked to adipocyte dysfunction and insulin resistance, whereas lifestyle interventions and pharmacological agents that promote adipocyte oxidative capacity promote metabolic health and insulin sensitivity. Studies over several years have identified important regulators of adipocyte oxidative metabolism, such as members of the PGC-1 coactivator family, and nuclear receptors of the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) and ERR (Estrogen-related receptor) subfamilies. These transcription factors exert their effects on gene expression and cellular function by both direct and indirect regulation of hundreds of genes that coordinately promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. Mining of genes regulated by PGC-1s and ERRs, coupled to bioinformatic approaches to determine associations of PGC-1/ERR targets with PPAR pathways and metabolism, has led us to identify a new and poorly characterized protein, Mcrip2, as highly associated with adipocyte oxidative metabolism. The premise of this proposal is that Mcrip2, a protein of unknown cellular and molecular function, that has not been linked yet to metabolism or physiology, is induced by PGC-1, PPAR and ERR factors, acts to enhance basal and adrenergically stimulated expression of oxidative metabolism genes, and is thus a critical element of the regulatory networks that control adipocyte oxidative metabolism. Interactions of Mcrip2 with proteins involved in mRNA processing and turnover suggest that Mcrip2 exerts its function by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Notably, we know little about mechanisms controlling post- transcriptional steps in adipocyte oxidative metabolism pathways. The proposed work will define the role of Mcrip2 in adipocyte basal oxidative metabolism and adrenergic responses, using gain- and loss-of function approaches in primary brown and inguinal adipocytes, and delineate the level at which Mcrip2 impacts gene expression. It will also determine the physiologic significance of Mcrip2 for mitochondrial function and adaptive thermogenesis, using a mouse model. Finally, the studies will elucidate the mechanism by which Mcrip2 impacts adipocyte biology, by defining Mcrip2 protein domains required for function and critical Mcrip2 interacting partners in basal and adrenergically stimulated adipocytes. In sum, the work will give first insights into post-transcriptional regulation of adipocyte oxidative function, and may suggest new targets and avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases that can benefit from increases in oxidative capacity, such as obesity and obesity-related diseases.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2757,377,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih
