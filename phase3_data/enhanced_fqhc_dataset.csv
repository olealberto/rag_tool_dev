5T35DK131960-03,Short-Term Research Training Program in NIDDK Mission Areas,"Substantive research training early during the course of medical school education is critical to address the declining number of physicians choosing research careers. The proposed University of Illinois Short-Term Research Training Program (SRTP) will provide first year medical students (12 slots in Year 1, 15 in Year 2-5) with a 10-week mentored research experience in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) mission areas including, kidney, urologic and hematologic diseases; digestive disease and nutrition; and diabetes, endocrinology and metabolic disease. The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UI COM) is a large public medical school with one of the most diverse student populations in the country in terms of enrolled African American and Latino students. The program will draw from first year medical students at UI COM, as well as other medical schools in the Chicago metropolitan area and Midwest. We have assembled an outstanding team of mentors in NIDDK mission areas with expertise in basic/mechanistic, clinical/translational, and behavioral/community-based research. In addition to mentored research, students will participate in an interactive structured curriculum focused on research methodology, responsible conduct of research, and career development. To learn presentation skills and principles of rigor and reproducibility, students will co- lead, with a research mentor, journal clubs and works-in-progress sessions. Additional novel aspects of the program include use of peer-to-peer mentoring and ongoing exposure to successful early career physician- scientists. At the end of the summer, students will present at a SRTP Research Symposium and the COM Research Day. After the program is completed, the program will utilize multiple strategies to facilitate continued involvement in research activities, including encouraging students to apply to the James Scholar Program, a program that provides the infrastructure to support research during the second to fourth years of medical school. In addition, the program will strive to create a sense of community among SRTP cohorts by hosting quarterly “Ideas on Tap” (research/social networking events at which students present ongoing research), and will maintain connections with trainees using the program website, newsletters, an SRTP Slack communication channel, and social media. An Executive Committee will oversee implementation of the program, recruitment/selection, program evaluation, and tracking of short- and long-term outcomes. Strengths of the program include the experienced co-Directors, committed and well-funded program mentors with broad expertise across NIDDK mission areas, an innovative structured curriculum, a robust recruitment plan to enhance diversity, strong institutional support, and a thoughtfully conceived plan to foster continued research involvement after program completion. Consequently, the proposed SRTP will provide medical students with a substantive research experience, facilitating the achievement of the long-term objective of increasing the pipeline and diversity of physicians entering the research workforce in NIDDK mission areas.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3202,447,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R33HL155160-04,"The ALOHA trial: Addressing Quality of Life, Clinical Outcomes, and Mechanisms in Uncontrolled Asthma Following the DASH Dietary Pattern","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Asthma prevalence has increased markedly in the United States, with 19 million adults reporting current asthma and 62% of them with uncontrolled asthma. Poor diet quality is an important risk factor implicated in this alarming trend as a typical western diet features processed, energy-dense, nutrient-deficient foods, promoting a proinflammatory host environment. Diet quality in asthma is an emerging area of research; few interventional trials have investigated healthy dietary patterns in adults with asthma, none was adequately powered to determine efficacy, and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To fill this gap, the current 2-phase, milestone-driven ALOHA trial will rigorously evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of a behavioral intervention promoting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). This behavioral intervention showed promising results in a pilot trial among adults with uncontrolled asthma. METHODS: The R61 phase (1 year) will focus on finalizing trial planning and preparation and begin early enrollment; in the R33 phase (4 years) we will conduct a 2-arm randomized clinical trial over 12 months. Adults with uncontrolled asthma (n=320) on standard controller therapy will be equally randomized and assessed at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months. The control and intervention groups will be matched on the number, frequency, and format of sessions over 12 months while the length of each session is proportional to the content delivered. Control participants will receive education on lung health, asthma, and other general health topics using American Lung Association and UpToDate materials. The intervention group will receive the same health education and materials in addition to DASH behavioral counseling. Central hypothesis: Compared with the education-only control, the DASH behavioral intervention will lead to significantly more participants with a clinically significant improvement (responders) in asthma-specific quality of life (primary outcome) and significantly greater improvements in related asthma and non-asthma outcomes, which will be mechanistically linked to improved diet quality. SPECIFIC AIMS: First, to determine intervention efficacy on the primary outcome of clinically significant improvement in asthma-specific quality of life at 12 months and secondary outcomes (asthma control, lung function, generic qualify of life, blood pressure, mental health, sleep health). Second, to examine the intervention effects on metabolomic (circulating short-chain fatty acids: propionate, butyrate, acetate), immune response (interferon-gamma, IL-5, IL-17A, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα), and physiologic (bronchodilator responsiveness) biomarkers of asthma. Third, to examine the intervention effects on self- reported and objective indices of diet quality (DASH score, dietary inflammatory index, serum carotenoids). We also will conduct exploratory analyses of causal mediation linking diet quality, biomarkers, and asthma outcomes as well as effect modification by sex and other biological variables (age of asthma onset, atopy). IMPACT: This trial has high potential to advance the clinical and mechanistic understandings of diet quality in asthma.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3302,462,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DE033167-02,Dual Delivery of Engineered EVs and Growth Factor for Bone Regeneration,"The inflammatory conditions and the complex physiological changes associated with chronic immunological responses to wound healing in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) challenge the outcomes of the treatments for bone regeneration. The related morbidity and costs associated with bone healing failures are considerable and increasing. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that the immune system is tightly linked to bone physiology and that MSC derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a prominent role in immunomodulation of bone repair. While recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2) mediated bone regeneration is well established, the challenges of controlling inflammation arising from rhBMP2 usage is exacerbated in the presence of immunomodulating systemic diseases such as T2DM present a significant knowledge gap that limit clinical outcomes. Based on preliminary studies of inflammation informed MSC EV microRNA (miRNA) composition and effects on immunomodulation and bone regeneration, we hypothesize that a dual delivery of engineered MSC EVs with anti-inflammatory properties and rhBMP2 using a combinatorial delivery system with self-assembling leucine zipper (LZ) peptide-based hydrogels and alginate beads can enhance bone healing in T2DM. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. In aim 1, we will test our preliminary data driven hypothesis that a subset of altered miRNAs in preconditioned MSC EVs contributes to the enhanced immunomodulatory function of the inflammatory preconditioned MSC derived EVs. We will also generate engineered MSC EVs that overexpress candidate miRNA with anti-inflammatory properties to further study the mechanistic aspects by which individual EV related miRNAs control the immunomodulation functionality. In aim 2, we will create a novel dual delivery system with LZ-hydrogels and alginate beads that contain engineered EVs and rhBMP2 respectively. We will test our hypothesis that 1) EVs with anti-inflammatory properties (generated from aim 1) can be released during the inflammatory phase of healing (up to 7 days) from a self-assembling LZ- hydrogel and 2) rhBMP2 that is encapsulated in alginate beads with an extended-release profile (4-6 weeks) can provide a long term osteoinductive signal to promote/enhance bone regeneration. In aim 3, using a diabetic mouse calvarial defect model, we will test the hypothesis that engineered MSC EVs containing anti-inflammatory miRNA will suppress inflammation upon wounding while sustained released rhBMP2 promote bone healing. Overall, the results of these first studies of the combinatorial usage of engineered and MSC EVs rhBMP2 will provide a foundation for continued definition of MSC EV-mediated immunomodulation, and the regenerative properties and applicability of the dual delivery system to bone healing in T2DM. Further, these studies will also provide a framework for the use of growth factors and engineered EVs in combination for tissue engineering applications.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2991,429,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R01EY035221-01A1,Pathophysiology of Chronic and Delayed Mustard Gas Keratopathy,"This is an application to the Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) NIH-wide program part of the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program. Sulfur mustard (SM), a chemical warfare agent, and nitrogen mustard (NM), a chemotherapeutic agent, are both potent vesicants. The cornea is exquisitely sensitive to these agents leading to keratitis, vascularization, ulceration, and perforations. Following acute SM exposure, a subset of patients will experience chronic/delayed-onset ocular complications known as mustard gas keratopathy (MGK). Delayed MGK reportedly can manifest several years after the initial exposure and presents with severe corneal disease with significant visual loss. We have made the observation that in experimental animal models of NM injury to the cornea, there is dose-dependent increased senescence in the cornea. We hypothesize that senescence in the cornea promotes tissue dysfunction and inflammationand that senescence after mustard injury contributes to the progression of chronic MGK and the severity of delayed MGK. We further hypothesize that reducing/eliminating senescent cells may alter the progression and severity of MGK. In this application we propose in Aim1 to investigate the role of senescence and SASP in the progression of corneal disease following acute exposure to NM; and in Aim 2 to investigate the role of senescence in a new model of delayed MGK. At the conclusion of these studies, we expect to have an improved understanding of the role of senescence in the development of MGK and identify novel approaches for its prevention/treatment.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,1603,235,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1F30MH138058-01,Sleep as a Mechanism of Premenstrual Exacerbation of Depression and Suicidality,"Aligned with the NIMH 2023 Strategic Plan, which highlights suicide prevention and digital health as research priorities, the proposed project is consistent with NIH’s strategic goal to examine mental illness trajectories across the lifespan. The proposed project utilizes high-resolution digital health sleep data in a clinical trial to identify periods of acute suicide risk and potential sleep-related treatment targets, while also examining the impact of the menstrual cycle in these processes. Suicide is a leading cause of death, and it is important for ongoing studies to focus on when patients may be at imminent risk. Emerging research suggests the menstrual cycle and sleep disturbances are time-varying modulators of acute depression and suicidality. The primary mentor’s prior work substantiates a link between cyclical changes in ovarian steroids and suicidality and confirms that most patients recruited for recent suicidal ideation (SI) demonstrate perimenstrual worsening of SI. Further, the laboratory’s two crossover RCTs demonstrate that natural perimenstrual steroid withdrawal serves as a recurring trigger for worsened suicidality and depression that can be reversed with E2+P4 supplementation. However, treatment of this kind is not feasible long-term due to clotting and hormone-dependent cancer risks, so it is critical to identify physiological mediators of these effects which may be treatment targets. Sleep disturbances also predict acute increases in suicidality/depression and there is within-person worsening in sleep perimenstrually suggesting that sleep may be a time-varying physiological mediator for the relationship between the cyclical hormones and suicidality in some people. The proposed study will utilize archival data from the primary mentor’s recently completed R01-funded RCT, which the candidate was instrumental in collecting, in 150 AFAB transdiagnostic patients with suicidality, including 1-3 months of daily surveys, hormonally confirmed cycle phases, and wearable sleep data (Oura ring), to evaluate the role of sleep in perimenstrual exacerbation of SI/depression. The proposed study has several novel aspects: 1) High temporal resolution sleep data across long observation periods; 2) Analytic methods that consider individual differences in cyclical hormone sensitivity and sleep patterns; 3) Experimental ovarian hormone manipulation to establish causality in the relationship between sleep disturbances, cycling hormones, and suicidality/depression. The proposed project will provide clinical trial research experience, training in nomothetic and idiographic statistical modeling, and collaborative mentorship in methods and clinical exposure in sleep and reproductive psychiatry to help the candidate achieve long-term career goals in academic medicine.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2812,387,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R35GM146936-03,Pyroptosis is a Trial-by-Fire Program,"TITLE Pyroptosis is a Programmed Trial-by-Fire. PROJECT ABSTRACT The inflammatory cell death program pyroptosis occurs in a wide range of cell types and plays important roles in development, tissue injury, and tumor growth. Curiously, unlike other cell death mechanisms, cells frequently survive pyroptosis activation. The persistence of a family of “inefficient” cell death genes is puzzling and suggests they may have other roles. Intuitively, cells that survive the inflammatory insult will dictate both the short-term adaptation and long-term repair and regeneration afterwards. Therefore, a flawed death program may actually be a “trial”. However, the details of cell survival after pyroptosis and the biochemical circuitry beyond its activation are under-studied, hindering our basic understanding. In this Program, we hypothesize that cell death is a side- effect of pyroptosis, which in fact aims to reprogram cell functions. To explore the new concept that “trial-by-fire” provides strong evolutionary advantages, we will investigate 1) whether it is possible to stop/resume pyroptosis and the basic mechanisms used to exert such control; 2) the capacity and limits of pyroptosis signaling; and 3) the single cell phenotypic effects of weathering pyroptosis. In pursuing this central hypothesis, we will discover new cell signaling circuits and simultaneously enhance the field’s ability to detect novel pathways by developing new genetically encoded tools, imaging algorithms, and bioinformatics methods. The Program aims to construct a new perspective that the salient function of pyroptosis is to prime and educate through a near-death experience.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,1659,240,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1F30HD116496-01,Investigation of Social and Behavioral Drivers of HIV Risk Among South African Adolescent Girls and Young Women,"South Africa has the greatest burden of HIV infection in the world, and South African adolescent girls and young women (SA-AGYW) ages 15-24 are at greatest risk. Mental health distress (anxiety, trauma, depression) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are implicated as drivers of HIV, yet few studies have assessed the combined effects of mental health and IPV on SA-AGYW sexual risk behavior (early sexual debut, no condom use at last sex, multiple sexual partners). Notably, high warmth and frequent communication about sexual topics between female caregivers and AGYW are associated with reduced AGYW sexual risk behavior, but few studies have examined the impact of female caregiver-AGYW communication and warmth in the presence of mental health distress and IPV on AGYW sexual risk taking. The proposed fellowship will provide much needed training to prepare me for a career as a physician scientist with a global health program of research. Guided by an expert mentorship team to oversee my training activities, I will gain skills in adolescent and young adult mental health distress, sexual risk behaviors, and their roles as drivers of HIV infection, HIV epidemiology, advanced qualitative research, and complete my medical and PhD degrees. I will use these new skills to carry out a mixed methods research study integrating quantitative and qualitative methods to accomplish two specific aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct secondary analyses of baseline data from a large HIV prevention intervention involving SA-AGYW and their female caregivers (IMARA-SA). Analyses of 642 AGYW will examine mental health distress, IPV, and AGYW-caregiver warmth and communication as drivers of AGYW sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Preliminary data from the parent study revealed high rates mental health distress and IPV. I hypothesize that increased warmth and communication between AGYW and female caregivers will decrease the association between mental health distress and sexual risk behaviors even in the presence of IPV. In Aim 2, I will supplement the quantitative analysis with 20- 30 qualitative interviews with SA-AGYW with experiences of IPV. I will purposively select participants from the parent study who have completed the 12-month follow up and reported IPV. Interviews will offer new insight into the impact of female caregiver communication about addressing experiences of IPV and sexual risk behavior. The findings from aims 1 and 2 will inform interventions to improve the SA-AGYW mental health, lessen IPV exposure, and strengthen sexual and reproductive health. Mentorship provided by an experienced team with a long history of collaboration will ensure excellent training, extensive opportunities to publish in high impact journals and present at international scientific conferences, and exposure to colleagues through networking. This F30 fellowship will provide a well-rounded education that empowers me to become a physician-scientist with a program of research focused on AGYW sexual and reproductive health.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3042,458,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL161386-03,Role of Adiposomes in Diabetes-Associated Endothelial Dysfunction and Restorative Effects of Exercise and Metabolic Surgery,"The development of type II diabetes (T2D) is strongly associated with obesity, and both are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Vascular dysfunction is an early event in developing cardiovascular disease in obese diabetic (OB-T2D) patients. Therefore, we set our long-term goal to define molecular mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and corrective strategies that target these mechanisms, such as physical activity and weight loss. We recently discovered that human adipose tissues release extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) that are efficiently captured by endothelial cells. Adiposomes are known to carry bioactive cargos such as proteins and micro RNAs; however, their lipid content has not been studied, neither their ability to transfer their lipid cargo to endothelial cells. In the current application, we propose investigating the role of adiposomes in communicating the unhealthy milieu, mainly dysregulated lipids, to endothelial cells in OB-T2D subjects. On top of these lipid species that we propose to be carried by adiposomes are glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs originate from ceramide glycosylation, a chemical process that is upregulated in the presence of inflammation and high glucose levels. Our preliminary findings showed that in endothelial cells, GSL-rich adiposomes disturb plasma membrane structure and subsequently induces endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, we found preconditioning endothelial cells with high shear stress (which is an exercise mimetic) protected endothelial cells from the detrimental effects caused by adiposomes. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that adipose tissues in OB-T2D patients release GSL-loaded adiposomes that induce vascular endothelial dysfunction. We propose that exercise and weight loss interventions (bariatric surgery) will restore adipose tissue homeostasis, reduce GSL-loaded adiposomes, and subsequently alleviate vascular risk in OB-T2D patients. We will test our hypotheses by pursuing the following Aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of GSL-rich adiposomes in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in OB- T2D adults; Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of exercise training in reducing adiposome-mediated effects on vascular function; and Aim 3: Examine changes in adiposome/caveolae axis following metabolic surgery and their association with vascular function. This study will improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological underpinning of adiposome production, packaging, and role in inducing ED under conditions of obesity and T2D. It will also identify adiposomes and the proposed mechanisms of their interaction with endothelial cells as novel therapeutic targets for improving vascular function in OB-T2D individuals. Once these pathways are elucidated, strategies for targeting them can be advanced, leading to an improved therapeutic management of T2D-related cardiovascular disease.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2898,398,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL152515-04,Amplification Mechanisms of Lung Endothelial Inflammation During Acute Lung Injury,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Lung failure from endotoxemia and sepsis induces widespread and often rapid lung vascular endothelial injury due to unfettered influx of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. This maladaptive inflammatory response outpaces the reparative capacity of lungs, resulting in profound inflammatory lung injury and hypoxemia. This proposal focuses on fundamental amplification mechanisms underlying the maladaptive inflammatory activation of the lung endothelium. Our central hypothesis is that the inflammatory response to threat signals such as the initial breaching of the endothelial plasma membrane by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rapid release of mitochondrial DNA by the injured mitochondria into the cytosol massively and acutely amplifies the inflammatory response and thus serves as essential feed-forward mechanisms for progression of acute lung injury (ALI). In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which the recently identified perforin Gasdermin D mediates endothelial plasma membrane pore formation and the mechanisms of activation of the K+ efflux ion channel TWIK2 that we have recently identified. We will address the role of amplifying K+ efflux on the severity and rapidity of endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and fulminant lung injury. In Aim 2, we will define another crucial amplification mechanism, the potentially important role of Gasdermin D-mediated mitochondrial (mt) membrane pore formation and the release of mtDNA, which may also catastrophically amplifiy lung injury via activation of Type I interferon signaling. These mechanistically driven studies will utilize genetic mouse models (endothelial specific knockout models in our labs) as well as comprehensive imaging, electrophysiological and physiological approaches and thus provide the framework for identifying novel endothelial amplification inflammatory mechanisms that induce lung vascular injury and ALI. We will elucidate how these pathways can be targeted to reduce tissue damage and improve survival.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2059,287,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01MD014839-04,Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE),"This application proposes to examine a novel social epigenetic mechanism for racial inequality in lung cancer: Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE). We will examine the relationships between exposure to violence, inflammatory responses, smoking and epigenetic changes in protein arginine methyl transferases (PRMT6) that increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that smoking induces increased expression of PRMT6 in the lung epithelium. We also showed that overexpression of PRMT6 triggers spontaneous lung tumors in mice. Interestingly, we found that PRMT6 is upregulated among black men compared with white men in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thus we argue that the increased overexpression of PRMT6 among black men may explain a higher rate of lung cancer among black men compared with white men. While smoking is a key contributing factor for lung cancer, the frequency and amount of cigarette smoking are not necessarily higher for blacks, which suggests that other factors are responsible for racial disparity in lung cancer. Disproportionate social stress in black communities may be responsible for a higher rate of lung cancer among blacks. In particular, individuals living in excessive neighborhood violence are exposed to chronic stress, which may intensify the epigenetic changes for lung cancer. We hypothesize that exposure to neighborhood violence is social stress that increases biophysical inflammatory responses, which exacerbate the path between smoking, PRMT6 overexpression, and lung cancer. To examine the proposed social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity, first, we will test the independent effect of smoking and exposure to neighborhood violence, and the interaction of the two risks on PRMT6 expression using retrospective tissue samples from black and white lung cancer cases (Aim 2). Second, we will test the effect of exposure to violence on an inflammatory response (hair cortisol) and lung cancer screening outcomes by conducting a prospective survey and data collection with high-risk black men (Aim 3). Finally, we will build a multilevel, context-specific lung cancer risk profiles (Aim 1) that take into account not only individual behavioral risk (smoking), but neighborhood stress (exposure to violence), physiological inflammatory responses (increased cortisol), and molecular changes (PRMT6 overexpression). To develop such risk profiles, we utilize a composite population data approach to establish accurate counts of all individuals within census tracts with sociodemographic, behavioral, and neighborhood risk profiles. The strength of RECODE is its innovative approach to unveil a social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity. RECODE has the potential to transform understanding multilevel risks of lung cancer and improve the national lung cancer screening guidelines to reflect the social conditions of racial minority communities.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3013,433,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R24EY033598-03,Alleviation of ER stress as a translational strategy to curb ocular viral infections,"Infection-associated blindness caused by herpesviruses is a leading cause of vision loss in the United States. Frontline therapies include the use of nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir which inhibit the viral thymidine kinase to restrict viral DNA replication. However, emergence of drug resistance and lack of strong corneal bioavailability have made it an urgent priority to develop alternative therapeutics. We have recently discovered a new mechanism through which herpesviruses, exemplified by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), propagate in the corneal epithelium. We have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized host protein cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) is essential to HSV-1 replication. Our findings shift the current understanding that CREB3 is only a cellular homolog of HSV-1 VP16. We showed that it is an important pro-viral factor that can be exploited to generate novel therapeutics against HSV infections. We for the first time showed that its modulation via a chemical chaperone 4- phenylbutyrate sodium (Na-PBA), can alleviate, ER stress, reduce CREB3 expression and inhibit viral replication. PBA is currently approved to treat urea cycle disorder. Our translational results are supported by strong in vivo murine data that suggests antiviral efficacy and topical dosage safety of Na-PBA. Due to the high sodium burden associated with Na-PBA administration, its unpalatability, and inability to penetrate sufficiently through corneal epithelium upon topical administration, we have developed various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations to overcome limitations associated with oral and topical delivery of Na-PBA. The purpose of this R24 application is to generate preclinical data in two animal models that support an IND application for repurposing PBA to treat ocular HSV infection. This will be achieved via 3 well thought, exhaustive specific aims. In the first aim, we will evaluate dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, and safety of orally and topically delivered Na-PBA solution and various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations. Furthermore, we will also determine oral and topical, and oral antiviral efficacy of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA nanoformulations in murine models of ocular HSV-1 infection. The second aim will use the most effective oral and topical formulation(s) and test their safety, PK, and efficacy in guinea pig and rabbit models of primary and reactivated ocular HSV-1 infection. Finally aim 3, we will investigate the potential of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA formulations to synergize with existing antiviral therapies to determine their potential as an add-on modality to the existing treatment. The latter is likely and significant since PBA is a rare drug that works via alleviating ER stress and aiding the host cell’s response to viral infection, and thereby reducing the chance for emergence of viral resistance. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team including scientists, clinicians, drug development and translation experts who can help us navigate through requisite FDA guidelines. PBA has the potential to become a safe and efficacious alternative to existing ocular antivirals very quickly.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3211,467,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5P50AA022538-10,Epigenetic Mechanisms of Positive  Affective State of AUD,"Project Summary As a hallmark of alcohol use disorder (AUD), the withdrawal syndrome includes both negative symptoms like anxiety and motivational symptoms such as craving for alcohol, which promotes relapse and alcohol seeking. Understanding how alcohol withdrawal changes brain physiology is an important step towards developing effective treatments to reduce alcohol abuse. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is an important brain area that projects to components of the extended amygdala, including the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Changes in the physiology of VTA neurons induced by withdrawal may underlie the alcohol-seeking during AUD. The sensitivity of neurons of the VTA to inhibition by gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is decreased during alcohol withdrawal but normalized by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, indicating epigenetic changes induced by withdrawal in the VTA may be amenable to pharmacological manipulation. Whole genome sequencing and molecular studies of this project identified a cluster of genes that encode cholesterol synthesis pathway enzymes that showed decreased expression during alcohol withdrawal, and are functionally relevant to decreased GABA sensitivity in VTA neurons during withdrawal. The proposed project plans to further characterize the role of specific epigenetic modifications in withdrawal-induced regulation of genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis, and the effect of these changes in withdrawal-induced GABA hyposensitivity and drinking behaviors. By using electrophysiological, behavioral, and state of the art molecular biological methods such as chemogenetics and CRISPR technology, we anticipate achieving the following goals: 1) to reveal novel epigenetic marks and changes in gene expression associated with chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal with whole genome approaches, 2) to examine whether decreased histone acetylation and increased histone methylation reduce expression of cholesterol synthesis enzymes in the VTA during withdrawal in a cell-type specific manner, and probe the role of cholesterol synthesis enzyme genes in withdrawal-related drinking behavior and GABA hyposensitivity, 3) to determine whether targeted epigenetic intervention counteracts withdrawal-induced phenotypes by using CRISPR to prevent decreases in histone acetylation on promoters of key cholesterol synthesis enzyme genes, and 4) to translate to post-mortem human alcoholic VTA the epigenetic dynamics and expression of genes related to GABA hyposensitivity that have been identified in the rat VTA. Ultimately, these studies are needed to understand epigenetic adaptation of VTA neurons involved in the positive affective state during alcohol withdrawal, and, with the other components of this Center, will provide a great deal of information on epigenetic mechanisms involved in withdrawal-induced brain changes, and possible pharmacological approaches toward more effective treatment of AUD.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2987,409,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5P50AA022538-10,Epigenetics  Core,"Project Summary The goal of the Epigenetics Core is to provide a robust common platform for the identification and analysis of genes affected by withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure in the brain. During the current funding period, the Epigenetics Core identified gene networks both induced and repressed by alcohol exposure or withdrawal in the amygdala, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area and limbic cortex and specific target genes that showed changes in RNA levels, as well as, in H3K9/14ac levels were functionally validated. In the current submission, the proposed Aims will allow preclinical CARE Research Projects (Projects 1-3) to obtain novel information regarding genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and histone methylation (H3K27me3 ChIP-seq). These findings will be integrated with data obtained during the current funding period (RNA-seq and H3K9/14ac ChIP-seq). We will also perform ATAC-seq and RNA-seq in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the alcohol use disorder (AUD)/control cohort obtained from the New South Wales Tissue Resource Center (Project 4). In addition, we will investigate the across genome levels of 5- hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in the same tissue using Illumina’s EPIC Methylation Array. Results from these studies will reveal brain region-selective changes in genes that are likely to contribute to alcohol use disorders. The above studies constitute Aim 1 of the Core. Aim 2 proposes bioinformatics pipelines for the analyses of the genome-wide datasets and the 5hmC array and integrating the large datasets for both preclinical and post- mortem studies. The integration of datasets from multiple non-biased approaches is innovative and will provide context for interpreting changes in the gene regulatory landscape in response to withdrawal from alcohol. In Aim 3, we propose to employ a novel dCas9:P300 acetyl transferase fusion protein to alter acetylation levels at specific genomic loci. This will allow us to activate expression of key genes in specific brain regions by altering acetylation selectively at their corresponding promoters. Similarly, we will use a dCas9:Tet1 fusion protein to alter 5mC and 5hmC levels at glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) to modulate mRNA expression. The Epigenetics Core is using state-of-the-art technology to obtain genome-wide information to provide additional resources for each CARE component to address their specific hypotheses. The Core will perform quality control measures at many of the key steps of the protocols described above. In addition, key findings in the genome-wide measures will be validated by Core personnel in consult with Project leaders.

1U54HD113087-01,Training Core,"Training Core Abstract Rising rates of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among those who face persistent disparities, not only demand new approaches to transdisciplinary research, but these inequities mandate the training of a new research, clinical, and public health workforce who can address these challenges. This workforce must have a knowledge base that is steeped in the structural, environmental, behavioral, and biological factors that affect women’s maternal health, including pregnancy-related/associated mortality and severe maternal morbidity. In addition, the maternal health workforce must include those who represent communities typically underrepresented in the research, clinical care delivery, and public health. Commitment to the rigorous training and exposure of this workforce to a wide variety of diverse and transdisciplinary concepts, methods, and approaches to etiologic and intervention research is paramount. As such, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Maternal Health Research Center of Excellence proposes the development of a Training Program to build the research capacity of early stage investigators (ESIs), junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, research assistants (RAs), as well as clinical partners from community agencies who together will have a diverse set of skills and experiences to enable them to bring fresh insights, ask novel questions, and discover innovative approaches to reducing inequities in maternal health outcomes. A. Specific Aims 1. To increase the diversity of the maternal health research pipeline by recruiting and supporting the academic career development of racially and ethnically diverse postdoctoral and junior faculty fellows from a variety of clinical and public health backgrounds. 2. To develop and successfully implement a robust training program for early stage investigators, including junior clinical and public health faculty and post-doctoral fellows, to enable them to address a variety of research questions related to reducing maternal health inequities using innovative quantitative and qualitative research methods and strategies. 3. To provide community-based clinical partners with a robust research training experience that will enable them to successfully undertake or partner with investigators to conduct maternal health research. 4. To provide a strong research and journey mentoring program to early stage investigators to enable them to effectively address maternal health issues including reducing inequities in maternal health outcomes.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2554,355,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F30AI164843-04,Deciphering molecular mechanisms underlying vertical transmission of Listeria monocytogenes,"Pregnant women are more likely to be infected with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) than the general population, and the bacterium can be vertically transmitted leading to fetal infection and pregnancy loss. Despite its public/health/relevance, the determinants of maternofetal transmission remain undefined. Examination of clinical Lm isolates indicates that subpopulations of strains possess an enhanced ability for vertical transmission. One of these strains, 07PF0776, was first noted for its ability to target the heart, and this cardiotropism requires InlB, a bacterial surface protein known to be important for the invasion of mammalian cells. Experimental evidence indicates that InlB is similarly required for vertical transmission and that high InlB expression alone is sufficient to significantly enhance vertical transmission in an unrelated strain. The goal for this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which InlB enhances the vertical transmission of hypervirulent Lm strains and of Lm generally. The project aims are designed to connect strain-specific genetic variations to altered bacterial behavior, host pathology, and immune responses. The current working hypothesis is that enhanced translation of inlB occurs in Lm hypervirulent subpopulations as the result of a trinucleotide substitution in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the inlB transcript that promotes ribosome binding. It is also hypothesized that amino acid variations within InlB enhance InlB binding to the bacterial cell wall and thus increase InlB surface abundance. Aim 1 will determine how InlB levels are altered in 07PF0776 by looking at InlB synthesis, degradation, and cell wall affinity. This aim will also explore how the 5’ UTR contributes to increased protein expression. Aim 2 will determine how increased InlB expression promotes bacterial colonization of the placenta and fetus. Experiments will use pregnant mice as a model and compare strains with varying levels of InlB activity. Fluorescence microscopy combined with immuno-histochemistry will determine if InlB-high-expressing strains have enhanced invasion of specific placental cell types, or alternatively gain access through new portals of entry. RNAScope in situ hybridization and flow cytometry will establish how bacterial localization impacts the nature of the placental immune response. The ultimate goal of the above aims will be to establish the mechanisms by which strains of Lm cause severe fetal and neonatal disease. These studies may eventually allow for improved treatment of severe Lm infection and more effective strategies to protect pregnant women from Lm-induced pregnancy complications.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2694,389,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DE031737-03,Role of DMP1 Mediated Paracrine Signaling in Vasculogenesis,"For dentin repair or regeneration, it is important to have the timely appearance of blood vessels. Therefore, tissue-engineering strategies to regenerate the dentin-pulp complex require establishment of vasculature to deliver oxygen, nutrients, hormones, immune cells, minerals and also help in clearing cellular debris and metabolic waste products during the inflammatory and regenerative phases of healing. DMP1 (dentin matrix protein1) is a key regulatory protein in bone and dentin mineralization. We first demonstrated that it has a regulatory role in the regulation of hydroxyapatite nucleation and growth in the extracellular matrices of bone and dentin. Subsequently, we demonstrated that DMP1 was localized in the nucleus of preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts and thus served as a signaling molecule and promoted the differentiation of these precursor cells. Recently we discovered that DMP1 can stimulate the release of intracellular calcium in preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts. Depletion of intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum leads to ER stress. Cells cope with ER stress by activating the “Unfolded protein response” (UPR). One of our recent observations is that DMP1 stimulation can promote the secretion of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that ER stress activated by DMP1 functions to promote the transformation of adult stem cells such as dental pulp stem cells to endothelial cells and thereby promote vasculogenesis. In order to determine the mechanism by which DMP1 promotes vasculogenesis, we will examine the UPR signaling pathway. The UPR is initiated by three ER transmembrane proteins, of which our preliminary data show that DMP1 stimulation activated the ATF6 (Activating Transcription Factor 6) arm of the UPR. Accordingly, here we propose to study the mechanism by which ATF6 mediate transcriptional regulation of VEGF under ER stress. During dentin repair and regeneration, a major challenge is the maintenance of cell viability which depends on the availability of a functional vascular system. Accordingly, we will test the in-vivo vasculogenic competence and therapeutic potential of DMP1 in an in vivo pulp regeneration model. Understanding the complex functions of DMP1 could be valuable to develop therapies for fracture repair in bone or in the tooth to restore lost, damaged or diseased dentin-pulp complex.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2396,352,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R21AG080316-02,Co-translational Regulation in the Vasculature of Organ Systems with Aging,"The production of functional proteins is a multistep process whereby newly synthesized polypeptides are enzymatically processed, folded, and assembled into oligomeric complexes. Key maturation processes occur co-translationally by coupling mRNA translation and nascent protein maturation on the ribosomes, assisted by a network of regulatory proteins. Despite decades of basic research, our understanding of co-translational processes is shaped predominantly by genetic manipulations in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell models, but limited data exists in cells from intact mammalian physiological systems. To overcome this hurdle, this project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of co-translational regulation of nascent proteins as they reach their functional state within the angiogenic signaling pathways of the endothelium in the heart during aging. We have recently developed an approach and tested the potential for simultaneous isolation of proteins present within the actively translating polyribosome/mRNA complexes within the endothelium of the heart. State-of-the-art multiplex labelling and quantification of these proteins has permitted the identification of concordant and discordant regulated cell-specific pathways based on actively translating mRNA and protein profiles associated with the endothelial stress. Leveraging this innovative advancement in “functional co- translatomics”, we aim to study the changes in co-translational complexes within endothelial cell angiogenic ligand-receptor and cell-cell interaction signaling networks within the aging heart. In Aim 1 , we will define changes in the co-translational regulation of concordantly regulated angiogenic signaling pathways during neonatal and adult life with aging and gender. In Aim 2 , we will define the post-translational modifications of proteins within discordantly regulated angiogenic signaling pathways which may contribute to the impairment angiogenesis in the heart during aging. Ultimately this knowledge could aid in the development of more effective means for diagnosing and treating the impairment of angiogenesis that occurs with aging and predisposes the heart to cardiovascular disease and injury.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2206,296,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01AA031003-02,Role of RMTg afferents in mechanisms of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure,"PROJECT SUMMARY A significant number of individuals struggle to maintain sobriety as a result of withdrawal symptoms that emerge during early abstinence from alcohol. Despite this, pharmacotherapeutics for the treatment of withdrawal are lacking, at least in part, due to poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying symptoms of withdrawal. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is a GABAergic region that exerts inhibitory control over midbrain bioaminergic and cholinergic nuclei. Recently, work from our lab revealed significantly enhanced cFos expression, a marker of recent neuronal activity, in the RMTg of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposed rats 12 hours into acute withdrawal. In addition, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of the RMTg attenuates withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. However, the precise neural circuits that drive this putative RMTg hyperactivity is unknown. The lateral habenula (LHb) provides dense glutamatergic input to the RMTg and exhibits significant functional overlap with the RMTg. In addition, our preliminary data reveals a significant increase in cFos expression in RMTg-projecting lateral habenula (LHb) neurons during acute withdrawal. Together, these data lead us to hypothesize that LHb inputs to the RMTg play a mechanistic role in regulating symptoms of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. Experiments in the current proposal are designed to test this hypothesis by using in vivo chemogenetics to bidirectionally and selectively manipulate LHb-RMTg activity during behavioral tests of withdrawal symptoms including anxiety-like behavior, mechanical pain sensitivity, and impulsive choice. Additional work will use ex vivo slice electrophysiology to explore the physiological neuroadaptations that occur in this circuitry during withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. Findings from these experiments will shed new light onto the role of this neural circuit in regulating symptoms of withdrawal and by extension have the potential to uncover new neurobiological targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2092,292,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5R24EY032440-03,Immunotherapy for Ocular Surface Diseases,"We have discovered a new mechanism for inflammation on the ocular surface. First, we discovered the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) on the ocular surface of dry eye disease (DED) patients and subsequently, the presence of citrullinated proteins and anti- citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). ACPAs not only cause ocular surface disease, but also stimulate formation of NETs, thus creating a self-perpetuating cycle of chronic inflammation on the ocular surface. We present an innovative pathophysiological concept: DED is characterized by breach of self-tolerance towards citrullinated antigens with generation of autoantibodies (ACPAs) and NETs could represent a source of citrullinated antigens fueling the ACPA autoimmune response over the ocular surface. We performed a first-in-human pilot clinical trial and showed that ocular surface immune globulin (OSIG) eye drops, formulated from pooled human immune globulin products (IVIG), were safe and efficacious in treating DED patients. Our findings shift the current paradigm that focuses on T-cell mediated inflammation as central to the pathophysiology of DED to also include autoimmune inflammation that is driven by post- translational modifications in self-proteins (citrullination) and autoantibodies (ACPAs). The purpose of this R24 application is to produce preclinical data that supports a commercial Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The longer-term goal is for testing the efficacy of OSIG eye drops in clinical trials and positioning OSIG eye drops as a new topical biologic immunotherapy for DED patients. Therefore, in Aim A, we seek to develop an optimum OSIG eye drop formulation using Quality by Design (QbD) principles, test critical quality attributes (CQAs) and GMP manufacture clinical supplies. In order to use OSIG ophthalmic formulation in human, an FDA IND is a prerequisite, therefore, in Aim B, we propose to perform pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo toxicology and efficacy studies using the OSIG ophthalmic formulation to meet regulatory requirements for IND studies. In Aim C, we propose to perform a clinical study to identify DED subtypes, clinical presentations and patient characteristics that are most associated with ACPAs or NETs, hence most likely to show therapeutic benefit with OSIG therapy. To successfully achieve these three Aims, we have established a highly qualified, multi-disciplinary team that is experienced in ophthalmic drug development, and FDA processes and regulations. If the aims of this grant proposal are successfully achieved, we will be one-step closer to introducing the first immunotherapy for ocular surface diseases into clinical practice.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2738,401,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01MD014839-03,Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE),"This application proposes to examine a novel social epigenetic mechanism for racial inequality in lung cancer: Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE). We will examine the relationships between exposure to violence, inflammatory responses, smoking and epigenetic changes in protein arginine methyl transferases (PRMT6) that increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that smoking induces increased expression of PRMT6 in the lung epithelium. We also showed that overexpression of PRMT6 triggers spontaneous lung tumors in mice. Interestingly, we found that PRMT6 is upregulated among black men compared with white men in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thus we argue that the increased overexpression of PRMT6 among black men may explain a higher rate of lung cancer among black men compared with white men. While smoking is a key contributing factor for lung cancer, the frequency and amount of cigarette smoking are not necessarily higher for blacks, which suggests that other factors are responsible for racial disparity in lung cancer. Disproportionate social stress in black communities may be responsible for a higher rate of lung cancer among blacks. In particular, individuals living in excessive neighborhood violence are exposed to chronic stress, which may intensify the epigenetic changes for lung cancer. We hypothesize that exposure to neighborhood violence is social stress that increases biophysical inflammatory responses, which exacerbate the path between smoking, PRMT6 overexpression, and lung cancer. To examine the proposed social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity, first, we will test the independent effect of smoking and exposure to neighborhood violence, and the interaction of the two risks on PRMT6 expression using retrospective tissue samples from black and white lung cancer cases (Aim 2). Second, we will test the effect of exposure to violence on an inflammatory response (hair cortisol) and lung cancer screening outcomes by conducting a prospective survey and data collection with high-risk black men (Aim 3). Finally, we will build a multilevel, context-specific lung cancer risk profiles (Aim 1) that take into account not only individual behavioral risk (smoking), but neighborhood stress (exposure to violence), physiological inflammatory responses (increased cortisol), and molecular changes (PRMT6 overexpression). To develop such risk profiles, we utilize a composite population data approach to establish accurate counts of all individuals within census tracts with sociodemographic, behavioral, and neighborhood risk profiles. The strength of RECODE is its innovative approach to unveil a social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity. RECODE has the potential to transform understanding multilevel risks of lung cancer and improve the national lung cancer screening guidelines to reflect the social conditions of racial minority communities.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3013,433,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R01AG079894-01,Image-based cerebrovascular network snythesis(iCNS) to model Alzheimer's Disease,"Significant resources on age-related neurodegeneration are directed toward animal research in the assumption that results will inform our understanding of parallel processes in human. Yet, no reliable method exists to accurately translate cerebral blood flow or metabolic data from animal to human. For lack of rigorous mathematical methods for cerebral metabolic parameters between species, translation of valuable research data from mouse to human remains guesswork. There is a need for a predictive computational framework that quantifies cerebral blood flow and metabolism in normal and diseased human brain states. Our long term goal is to quantify fundamental physiological processes of aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), so that their effects can be slowed or even partially reversed. The objective is to expand the utility of MRI analysis by magnifying the detectability of age-related microcirculatory changes in humans with a mechanistic mathematical framework. It is our hypothesis that age and AD related changes in the microcirculation also generate macroscopic perturbations of hemodynamic and/or oxygen perfusion states that will be detectable with advanced MRI techniques, when guided by rigorous brain simulations over all relevant length scales. The rationale is that critical physiological metrics for dysfunction in aged brains (=aging biomarkers) will be exposed by systematic exploration and simulation of fundamental hemodynamic and metabolic processes. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1) Assess the predictive value of mechanistic modeling by simulating the link between capillary stalling, vascular tracer transit properties, and tissue oxygen delivery, and validate predictions using advanced microscopic imaging in mouse. We determine the effects of aging and AD in aged rodent brains. Aim 2) Develop mechanistic multiscale model for predicting the impact of cerebral perfusion on oxygen metabolism in the human cortex under normal and pathological conditions. Anatomically detailed mechanistic models of cerebral circulation in human will predict the effect of structural and functional changes in AD on oxygen extraction in the human brain with MRI. Aim 3) Assess the predictive value of mechanistic multiscale modeling to quantify microvascular properties across the human brain cortex in health and disease using advanced MRI. To validate the mechanistic translation from mouse to human, we will measure age-related metabolic functions in cohorts of aged and Alzheimer patients. We identify hemodynamic and metabolic metrics (=biomarkers) that correlate with cognitive decline This contribution is significant because it will predict how changes in vascular morphometry and metabolism lead to neurological decline. It will identify biomarkers visible in noninvasive diagnostic imaging in humans that signal age-related deterioration before symptoms develop.

1R21AI173863-01,Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2: the role of HLA class I,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since December 2019, coordinated research efforts have provided a wealth of critical data that have enhanced our ability to diagnose and treat COVID-19. To date, however, much of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remain elusive. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains nine independent open reading frames (ORFs) coding for proteins that are not essential for viral replication but seem to exert important functions in modulating host antiviral immunity. Of these accessory proteins, the ORF8 protein stands out for its unique characteristics. ORF8 is a highly variable protein among SARS-related CoVs. ORF8 also appears to be involved in a network of host-pathogen interactions inside infected cells: ORF8 impairs immune pathways such as antigen presentation, interferon type I, and nuclear factor-kB, as well as possibly activate growth pathways. A central question is how ORF8 mediates interactions with multiple host protein targets. Towards this goal, we are investigating ORF8 interaction with major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules. It was shown recently that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 suppresses CD8+ T cell responses by downregulating MHC I molecules, both in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that ORF8 suppresses surface expression of HLA-A and HLA-B molecules to protect infected cells from recognition by CD8+ T cells, but spares HLA-C and HLA-E to avoid activation of natural killer (NK) cells. The possibility that ORF8 displays a locus specificity toward MHC I would provide a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 to walk a fine line between adaptive and innate immunity. Specifically, we will undertake an analysis of interactions between ORF8 and MHC I by using a panel of HLA- A, -B, -C, and -E molecules, and also determine if ORF8 selectively downregulates MHC I in relevant cell systems (Aim 1). We will extend these studies to ORF8 variants that have been positively selected during the course of the pandemic and evaluate if and how these mutations affect MHC I binding and downregulation (Aim 2). The successful completion of these Aims is expected to uncover unknown features of ORF8 and elucidate its role in suppressing antigen presentation, as well as inform us on the selective pressure that MHC I exerts on SARS-CoV-2. The immediate and long-term impact of our proposed research is high. This is the first study that: (1) characterizes molecular interaction of ORF8 with a host protein; and (2) evaluates clinically relevant ORF8 variants. By studying the immune interactions underlying ORF8-mediated downregulation of MHC I, we will increase our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 derails cellular immunity. Importantly, our study will stimulate similar investigations of other ORF8-interactors, providing novel opportunities for the development of therapeutics directed against ORF8 or its host targets.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3010,453,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R24EY033598-02,Alleviation of ER stress as a translational strategy to curb ocular viral infections,"Infection-associated blindness caused by herpesviruses is a leading cause of vision loss in the United States. Frontline therapies include the use of nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir which inhibit the viral thymidine kinase to restrict viral DNA replication. However, emergence of drug resistance and lack of strong corneal bioavailability have made it an urgent priority to develop alternative therapeutics. We have recently discovered a new mechanism through which herpesviruses, exemplified by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), propagate in the corneal epithelium. We have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized host protein cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) is essential to HSV-1 replication. Our findings shift the current understanding that CREB3 is only a cellular homolog of HSV-1 VP16. We showed that it is an important pro-viral factor that can be exploited to generate novel therapeutics against HSV infections. We for the first time showed that its modulation via a chemical chaperone 4- phenylbutyrate sodium (Na-PBA), can alleviate, ER stress, reduce CREB3 expression and inhibit viral replication. PBA is currently approved to treat urea cycle disorder. Our translational results are supported by strong in vivo murine data that suggests antiviral efficacy and topical dosage safety of Na-PBA. Due to the high sodium burden associated with Na-PBA administration, its unpalatability, and inability to penetrate sufficiently through corneal epithelium upon topical administration, we have developed various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations to overcome limitations associated with oral and topical delivery of Na-PBA. The purpose of this R24 application is to generate preclinical data in two animal models that support an IND application for repurposing PBA to treat ocular HSV infection. This will be achieved via 3 well thought, exhaustive specific aims. In the first aim, we will evaluate dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, and safety of orally and topically delivered Na-PBA solution and various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations. Furthermore, we will also determine oral and topical, and oral antiviral efficacy of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA nanoformulations in murine models of ocular HSV-1 infection. The second aim will use the most effective oral and topical formulation(s) and test their safety, PK, and efficacy in guinea pig and rabbit models of primary and reactivated ocular HSV-1 infection. Finally aim 3, we will investigate the potential of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA formulations to synergize with existing antiviral therapies to determine their potential as an add-on modality to the existing treatment. The latter is likely and significant since PBA is a rare drug that works via alleviating ER stress and aiding the host cell’s response to viral infection, and thereby reducing the chance for emergence of viral resistance. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team including scientists, clinicians, drug development and translation experts who can help us navigate through requisite FDA guidelines.

5R01MH124723-03,Primary Care Based Depression Prevention in Adolescents: Intervention Optimization in Preparation for Implementation Study,"With more than 13% of adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorders each year, prevention of depressive disorders has become a key priority for the NIMH. Unfortunately, we have no widely available interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality (e.g. public health impact). To address this need, we developed a multi-health system “collaboratory” to develop and evaluate the primary care based-technology “behavioral vaccine,” Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive-Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal Therapy (CATCH-IT) (14 adolescent, 4 parent modules). Using this health-system collaboratory model, CATCH-IT demonstrated evidence of efficacy in prevention of depressive episodes in phase-three clinical trials in the United States and China. However, like many “package” interventions, CATCH-IT became larger and more complex across efficacy trials. Thus, adolescents and parents were less willing to complete all 18 modules, suggesting adolescent dose “tolerability” issues (e.g. satisfaction, acceptability and resource use, “time as cost”). Similarly, primary care practices have “scalability” challenges (acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost), resulting in declining REACH (percent of at-risk youth who complete intervention). To prepare for implementation studies and dissemination, we need to address adolescent tolerability and practice/health system scalability, while preserving efficacy. Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) uses a systematic analytic approach and a factorial randomized clinical trial design to address efficacy, tolerability, and scalability, simultaneously. We will use a MOST approach to optimize CATCH-IT for the prevention of depression (indicated prevention, i.e., elevated symptoms of depression) in practices and health systems representative of US geography and population. The theoretically grounded components of CATCH-IT selected for study and optimization are: behavioral activation, cognitive therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and parent program. We will use a 4-factor (2x2x2x2) fully crossed factorial design with N=16 cells (20 per cell, 15% dropout) to evaluate the contribution of each component. We propose to randomize N=378 (N=189) from each health system site. The at-risk youth will be high school students 13 through 18 years old, not currently experiencing a mood disorder, but with subsyndromal symptoms of depression (moderate to high risk). Using the efficient factorial design, we can assess the contribution to prevention efficacy of each component. Thus, the MOST study design will enable us to eliminate non-contributing components while preserving efficacy and to optimize CATCH-IT by strengthening tolerability and scalability by reducing “resource use.” By reducing resource use, we anticipate satisfaction and acceptability will also increase, preparing the way for an implementation trial and eventual US Preventive Services Task Force endorsement to support dissemination. Thus, our primary question is whether one component, or perhaps two, can demonstrate an equivalent effect to combinations of other components in terms of efficacy, whilst also demonstrating superior adolescent/family tolerability scalability over a 12-month follow-up.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3241,434,1.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

It includes mesenteric lipodystrophy (mesenteric fat necrosis), mesenteric panniculitis (chronic mesenteric fibrosis) and mesenteric lymphadentis (mesenteric lymph node inflammation). It is diagnosed by an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan; however, the cause of mesenteritis remains unknown. Emerging clinical evidence shows that mesenteritis is associated with gut inflammation such as IBD and Chron's Disease. As innate myeloid cells, macrophages are distributed throughout the whole organism and they play crucial roles in mediating tissue inflammation. Based on our supporting data, we identified macrophage populations in serous membrane of gut mesentery (termed membrane-associated macrophages). Thus, this research proposal seeks to address fundamental questions regarding the tissue specific role of membrane-associated macrophages in steady state and during mesenteritis induced gut inflammation. These include how membrane- associated macrophages are reprogrammed by local niches and gut inflammation. To better describe the role of these macrophages and its mechanism, we performed genetic studies of membrane-associated macrophages that provided insight into their roles in steady state and gut inflammation. These preliminary data results have led us to pursue to the following specific aims: (1) Determine distinct homeostatic functions of membrane-associated macrophages and local signals that shape their tissue specification; (2) Determine the role of membrane- associated macrophages during mesenteritis induced by gut inflammation. We will perform lineage tracing, cell ablation, transcriptomic analysis of membrane-associated macrophages and in vivo live imaging to understand the role and dynamic interactions of macrophages with local environment in steady state and during mesenteritis induced by gut inflammation. Ultimately, we hope our studies will lead to the discovery of therapeutic targets to prevent mesenteritis as well as gut inflammation.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2069,276,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL162308-02,Mechanisms and Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 induced Lung Endothelial Injury,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a devastating systemic inflammatory syndrome caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which has resulted in over 500,000 deaths in the US during the past year, with this high rate of mortality being attributed in large part to the development of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells requires the direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein to the principal host protease-TMPRSS2 and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors which are expressed in multiple host cell types. The development of efficacious vaccines to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 represents a tremendous advance that will help curb the COVID-19 pandemic, however the emergence of variants of concern such as the B1.1.7, P1 and B1.351 which can evade the neutralizing responses of the vaccine-induced humoral immune response underscores the urgent need to develop novel therapeutics to complement the vaccination efforts. Based on our provocative Supporting Data, we have formulated the overarching hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 induced lung endothelial injury is a requisite element of COVID-19 induced maladaptive inflammatory injury that can be therapeutically targeted. We propose the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will define the nature and underlying mechanisms of lung endothelial injury underlying COVID-19-induced ALI/ARDS. We will test the hypothesis that the degree of lung endothelial injury is a key determinant of the overall pathogenicity and mortality of multiple SARS- CoV-2 variants. We will establish SARS-CoV-2-induced lung vascular injury and compensatory lung endothelial regeneration using two complementary humanized ACE2 mouse models, EC-specific genetic lineage tracing, genetic stabilization of VE-cadherin and single cell RNA-Sequencing. In Aim 2, we will define the efficacy and optimal temporal windows for two targeted pharmacological therapeutic strategies in preventing and resolving SARS-CoV- 2 induced lung endothelial injury. We will test the hypothesis that an engineered soluble hACE-2 peptide has a higher therapeutic efficacy than the wildtype hACE-2 peptide in reducing lung endothelial injury as well as long-term EC reprogramming by preventing viral entry and dissemination of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We will test the corollary hypothesis and that targeted inhibition of IL1β-signaling using a modified IL-1 Receptor antagonist is protective against the feed-forward inflammatory loop and endothelial injury induced by multiple SARS-CoV2 variants. We will use two hACE-2 mouse models as well as compare distinct routes of delivery (intratracheal versus intravenous) and identify the optimal temporal windows for the therapeutic intervention.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2807,399,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R03EB032602-02,Valency and distance co-optimized peptide bound PEG-b-PPS Filomicelles hydrogel depot for anti-integrin therapeutics,"1 Project Summary: Anti-integrins are considered as promising alternative for angiogenesis related disease 2 conditions including cancer, Crohn’s, and retinal diseases. However, an optimal nanomaterial design by 3 considering the application and target cell receptor expression is extremely vital for the success of the 4 formulation. Although polymeric nanocarriers have demonstrated considerable potential associated with anti- 5 integrin peptide delivery, the peptide valency and surface distance are rarely co-optimized to enhance 6 therapeutic ligand clustering. Hence, the primary goal of this proposal is to develop and validate a novel 7 bioresponsive hydrogel depot for the sustained delivery of micelles carrying therapeutic peptides at an optimal 8 valency for therapeutic efficacy. A key innovation of this proposal is that we will use self-assembled poly(ethylene 9 glycol)-b-poly(propylene sulfide) (PEG-b-PPS) filomicelles (FM) that use cylinder-to-sphere thermodynamic 10 transitions for sustained in situ generation and delivery of peptide-loaded micelles (MC). In this proposed work, 11 the peptide’s valency and distance from the MC surface will be co-optimized for an efficient therapeutic effect. 12 As proof of concept, the current proposal will use an anti-integrin heptapeptide that showed therapeutic efficiency 13 in vitro using HUVEC cells. With the strong initial results, the objective of the current proposal is to study the 14 mechanistic investigation of the FM-hydrogel depot through in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo investigations and 15 generate preliminary data for future translational grant mechanisms involving appropriate animal disease 16 models. Ex vivo model in this proposal will assist in selecting the optimum formulation and reduce the use of 17 animals and align with the current grant mechanism. The following specific aims will be achieved: 18 AIM 1: Synthesize, optimization and In vitro characterization of FM-depots for the sustained release of MCs 19 displaying a co-optimized surface display of anti-integrin peptide (aANG-P). Aim 1a will address the development 20 of FM-depots with aANG-P constructs, verify control over the MC release rate and confirm that peptide valency 21 and bioactivity remain unchanged following the FM-to-MC transition. Aim 1b will study the inflammatory response 22 induced by FM depot using primary macrophages and confirm of therapeutic activity of the released MC using 23 HUVECs and macrophage cells. 24 AIM 2: Ex vivo and in vivo tissue distribution and bioactivity of aANGP-MC released from aANG-P FM-depots. 25 Aim 2a will study the micellar release kinetics, and tissue distribution from aANGP-FM injected suprachoroidal 26 space of excised rabbit whole eye and study the bioactivity using choroid sprouting assay and CAM assay. Aim 27 2b will confirm the tissue distribution of the aANGP-FM depot using Sprague Dawley rat model and study the 28 inflammatory response after injecting at suprachoroidal space. 29 The overall outcomes of the proposed project will be a nanomaterial-based translational approach that will 30 provide a novel sustained and prolonged release technology for ligand targeted retinal drug delivery which can 31 counter the complication of current technologies, which is a key focus of the NIH/NIBIB mission.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3320,491,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
2R01HL112626-10A1,Notch in Angiogenesis and Vascular Biology,"Elucidating the signaling pathways that control angiogenesis allows new therapies to be designed for treatment of diseases where blood vessels are contributors, including blindness, inflammation, and cancer. Notch1 signaling generally acts as a negative regulator of angiogenic sprouting. We hypothesize that Notch4, a Notch receptor primarily expressed in endothelium, has both overlapping roles with Notch1 and distinct endothelial functions. We demonstrated that Notch4 promotes angiogenesis and possibly inflammation of blood vessels and surrounding cells. By removing Notch4 expression in blood vessels of mice or blocking Notch4 using an inhibitor, we discovered that Notch4 promotes angiogenesis in the developing retina. Notch4 is expressed in blood vessels of many types of tumors and we demonstrated that blocking Notch4 inhibits tumor growth when Notch4 is in tumor vessels. We found that endothelial Notch4 appears to function to alter both vessels and adjacent stromal tissue. Analysis of Notch4-regulated genes led us to discover that specific cytokine signaling proteins are regulated by Notch4, and not Notch1, a possible mechanism for Notch4 broad influence on both vessels and surrounding tissue. In these studies, we will define the unique signaling mechanisms regulated by Notch4 to understand how Notch4 promotes developmental, inflammatory-driven, and tumor angiogenesis and evaluate anti-Notch4 treatment for therapeutic benefit. We will use a new technique called CUT&RUN to see which genes are directly activated by Notch4 or Notch1 and use a novel RiboFlag translational analysis to understand expression control by each Notch protein. We will determine if newly discovered Notch4-regulated proteins promote angiogenesis and inflammation in cultured endothelial cells and remove Notch4 expression from endothelial cells in mice to determine if this causes reduced blood vessel growth, reduces the response to inflammation and reduces tumor growth. We will separately remove Notch1 or Notch4 genes from endothelium or remove both genes and describe result of Notch loss on developmental and pathological angiogenesis, establishing unique and overlapping roles for these genes. A new Notch inhibitor allows us to investigate pre- clinical therapeutic potential for treatment of proliferative retinopathy, an inflammatory eye disease, and in tumors that have Notch4 in the endothelial cells. We will investigate the stromal changes in tumors caused by genetic or pharmacologic blockade of Notch4 using flow cytometry and focused single cell RNA sequencing. In all of these studies, we will determine if select cytokines are regulated by Notch4 in healthy and disease-associated blood vessels, with the goal of understanding the mechanisms by which Notch4 impacts inflammation of blood vessels and surrounding tissue or tumor. Our goals for this proposal will be to discover the unique ways that Notch4 works to build normal blood vessels and contributes to diseased vessels, and to evaluate therapeutic strategies to prevent blindness caused by excess angiogenesis, reduce vascular inflammation, and block tumors.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3136,454,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F30HL151182-04,Immune Dysregulation in Sarcoidosis,"Sarcoidosis is a poorly characterized immune disorder that has often been called the “Great Imitator” due to its similarity to a variety of other diseases and the difficulty of diagnosis. The disease causes aggregates of immune cells called granulomas to form in various tissues, causing organ damage and eventual death in severe cases. Sarcoidosis etiology remains largely unknown, with no clear trigger and symptoms that can disappear on their own or worsen despite treatment. Current research has uncovered associations with some common bacterial species as well as immune dysregulation, especially in the T helper 1, T helper 17, and T regulatory cell populations. However, progress in the field has been hampered in part by the complexity of the disease and limitations in current models. We hypothesize that distinct subpopulations of T cells drive immune dysregulation and progression in sarcoidosis. We further hypothesize that this dysregulation differentiates sarcoidosis from other granulomatous processes and provides a basis for disease specific modeling and drug discovery. Aim 1 will apply recently developed single-cell level sequencing techniques to better elucidate the complex network of gene and cell interactions involved in pathogenesis. Samples of sarcoidosis patient granulomas and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be analyzed via single-cell RNA sequencing. Their transcriptomes will be compared to the PBMCs of control subjects as well as control granulomas formed by stimulation of control PBMCs with purified protein derivative. Cells will be identified by their gene expression profiles, then assessed for differences in gene expression and regulation in sarcoidosis compared to controls. We will use this data to develop a transcriptomic atlas of cell types and regulatory networks in sarcoidosis. Aim 2 will use this atlas to evaluate in vitro sarcoidosis models which successfully utilized patient samples to elucidate differences between disease and controls. Granulomas created using each model will be analyzed via single-cell RNA-seq and compared to our sarcoidosis transcriptomic atlas. This approach fosters detailed evaluation of the sarcoidosis immune environment and the evaluation of the capability of existing sarcoidosis models to mimic sarcoidosis. This project integrates recent advances in sequencing and bioinformatics to uncover mechanisms involved in sarcoidosis. The single-cell transcriptomic atlas of sarcoidosis granulomas and PBMCs will interrogate cellular interactions that regulate immune dysfunction in sarcoidosis, providing new points of focus for further mechanistic research. Our analysis of sarcoidosis models will guide further model design, and design of high throughput biomarker and drug screens for sarcoidosis. This project has the potential to improve the specificity and efficacy of treatment, as well as the ease of diagnosis.

5R01HL148756-04,Rab GTPases-mediated mitochondrial clearance in diabetic cardiomyopathy,"PROJECT SUMMARY Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a common yet underestimated cause of heart failure and mortality in patients with diabetes. The underlying basis of this often-fatal syndrome is unknown, although multiple pathways converge on a common denominator - dysfunctional mitochondria. Understanding how damaged mitochondria are removed is critical, as the presence of damaged mitochondria leads to rapid generation of reactive oxygen species which then affect the remaining healthy mitochondria. This leads to wide-spread mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Although damaged mitochondria are believed to be degraded by mitochondrial autophagy (a specific form of autophagy), we have recently discovered the existence of a novel endosomal- mediated mitochondrial degradation pathway in cardiomyocytes exposed to hyperglycemia. The suppression of this pathway is potentially linked to increased susceptibility against diabetic cardiomyopathy. This observation was possible due to our ability to generate patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from diabetic patients with (T2DCM) and without (T2D) cardiomyopathy. We found that only T2D cells, but not T2DCM, exhibited increased endosomal-mediated mitochondrial degradation. However, neither the molecular cues regulating this novel pathway, nor the functional significance of this endosomal pathway, is established in cardiomyocytes from a diabetic heart. Thus, the goal of this project is to demonstrate the functional significance of the endosomal-mediated mitochondrial degradation pathway during diabetic cardiomyopathy and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating this pathway. Aim 1 will define the functional role of endosomal-mediated mitochondrial clearance in the diabetic heart by disrupting the function of Rab5 and Rab7, key determinants of the endo-lysosomal system. These studies will employ multiple innovative reagents, including CRISPR-mediated Rab knockout and overactivation iPSC lines and a novel inducible, cardiac-specific Rab7 knockout mouse model, to interrogate the importance of these Rabs in maintaining functional mitochondrial degradation in two distinct diabetic mouse models. Aim 2 will define the role of VPS34/UVRAG in generating phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate (PI3P) required for endosomal maturation and hence clearance of defective mitochondria. We have supporting data that mTOR is excessively upregulated in selected diabetic patients leading to phosphorylation of UVRAG, impairing its function to form a complex with VPS34 in generating PI3P for proper endosomal maturation and mitochondria degradation. Using both genetic and pharmacological methods, we will demonstrate that maintaining a stable UVRAG/VPS34 complex is a prerequisite for PI3P to mediate conversion of Rab5 into Rab7 for endosomal-mediated mitochondrial degradation. Collectively, these innovative studies will illuminate a novel endosomal-mediated mitochondrial degradation pathway as an important adaptive response in cardiomyocytes when exposed to hyperglycemic stress and pave the way for druggable targets in the future.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3118,417,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F30CA260791-03,Regulation of primary metastasis in high grade serous ovarian cancer,"High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is both the most common and most lethal ovarian cancer histotype. Though HGSOC has been long thought to originate in the ovary, recent evidence now suggests that HGSOC precursor lesions in fact originate in the fallopian tube. Further, select dysplastic cells from the fallopian tube disseminate from these precursor lesions and follow a variety of local migratory cues in order to colonize the ovary and establish a primary HGSOC tumor. The ovary seems to facilitate the expansion and spread of the ovary to the rest of the peritoneal space. Though this phenomenon is well documented, the molecular mechanisms that drive the initial dissemination of dysplastic fallopian tube cells to the ovary are poorly understood. To address this, our group has developed a new imaging mass spectrometry technique that has allowed for unprecedented insight into the paracrine factors that create a pro-metastatic niche and allow for the migration of fallopian tube cells toward the ovary. Using this technique, we determined that co-culture of murine ovary explants with dysplastic tubal cells leads to consistent increases in norepinephrine secretion from the ovary, later found to be produced by the ovary itself. This is significant, as norepinephrine is an established tumor promoter in advanced disease, and ovarian cancer patients taking β-blockers that interfere with norepinephrine signals typically have improved clinical outcomes. However, the role of norepinephrine in tumor development is largely unknown. Given the wide availability, low cost, and minimal adverse effects of β- blockers, should norepinephrine similarly enhance the development of HGSOC this may provide opportunity for early intervention and/or chemoprevention in high-risk patients. Given the potential to directly impact clinical practice, it is essential to further dissect both the mechanisms that direct norepinephrine biosynthesis, as well as the downstream effects of norepinephrine during HGSOC development. Through the experiments detailed in this proposal, we will gain valuable insight into these events in hopes of either preventing or delaying HGSOC development in high-risk patients.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2206,326,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DA050464-04,MASLIHAT Intervention for Tajik Male Migrants Who Inject Drugs,"PROJECT SUMMARY Labor migration is a major contributor to fueling the global AIDS epidemic and also the movement of HIV across country borders and populations. Migrants who inject drugs while in a host country are at especially high risk. Tajikistan, a small country in Central Asia, exports more than a million Tajiks annually, many of whom inject drugs, to work temporarily outside of their own country. Our earlier research on Tajik labor migrants in Moscow showed them to be at alarmingly high normative and behavioral risk for HIV due to risky drug use, needle sharing, alcohol consumption, and unsafe sex with casual and paid sex partners. To help curb transmission in this vulnerable population, we developed and pilot tested the ""Migrants' Approached Self- Learning Intervention in HIV/AIDS for Tajiks"" (MASLIHAT) prevention model. The model recruits and trains current and former Tajik migrants who inject drugs as ""peer educators"" in delivering the intervention to others in their social networks while simultaneously reducing their own risk. The MASLIHAT Intervention and our research efforts build synergistically on 3 theoretical models: social-cognitive-behavioral theory, social network theory and Yang's Theory of Migration. The model itself culturally adapts the successful SHIELD model, which is a CDC- designated evidence-based best practice intervention in the U.S., for use with Tajik labor migrants in Russia who inject drugs. This study will test the efficacy of the MASLIHAT intervention against a control condition designed to be equal to the intervention condition in the number of sessions, duration, and interest level. We will deliver MASLIHAT and control group interventions over 5 sessions with groups of 5 to 9 Tajik male migrants who inject drugs for a total of 10 groups for each intervention. The peer educators will share what they learned with others in their social networks, including the 2 network members who inject drugs whom they recruited for enrollment in the study. We will assess MASLIHAT and control participants and their Tajik male social network members at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-intervention. We will conduct repeated measures linear and logistic regressions using mixed effect models with random person intercepts to test: (1) if greater changes in HIV risk behaviors, prevention self-efficacy, and behavioral norms occur among MASLIHAT participants (peer educators) compared to control participants, and (2) if greater changes in HIV risk behaviors, prevention self-efficacy, and behavioral norms occur among peer educator network members compared to control group network members. By transforming their own risk behavior, and encouraging others at risk to do so as well, migrant peer educators can initiate positive changes at the individual and social network levels in both their host country and also their home country when they return. The impact of the proposed study lies in the development of a much needed scientifically tested intervention that reduces HIV transmission among migrants who inject drugs within and across country borders.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3121,479,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL155941-03,CREB Instruction of Macrophage Fate and Lung fluid homeostasis,"Recovery from severe forms of inflammatory vascular injury, such as acute lung injury (ALI), depends on the lung's capacity to rapidly activate tissue repair pathways. Macrophages (Mφ), the most abundant sentinel immune cell type in the lung, are required for restoration of tissue-fluid homeostasis following injury, but the identity of the reparative Mφ subpopulations and how they are generated remain elusive. Here, we have discovered a subset of the alveolar Mφ (AMφ) population that is required to maintain lung fluid homeostasis basally and induce tissue repair after injury. Our Supporting Data show that: 1) loss of cAMP Response Element Binding (CREB) protein expression in myeloid cells (Creb∆LyzM mice) arrest a subpopulation of the AMφ lineage at the pre-AMφ stage, leading to decreased AMφ generation and increased lung vascular permeability basally; 2) Creb∆LyzM mice failed to resolve injury post-LPS challenge and died more rapidly after Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection; 3) transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) and chromatin accessibility profiling (ATACseq) of flow-sorted CREB-null AMφ have markedly altered gene expression and chromatin remodeling; and 4) CREB is required to inhibit excessive production of nuclear acetyl-CoA from the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) through synthesis of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Based on these provocative Preliminary Data, in Aim#1, we will test the hypothesis that CREB transcriptionally promotes differentiation of this barrier reparative AMφ subpopulation. In Aim#2, we will investigate that CREB regulates reparative AMφ generation by controlling epigenetic modifications of histones thereby leading to AMφ gene transcription. Here, we will address the novel concept that the transcriptional activity of CREB is required to upregulate PDK4 expression, which in turn prevents transport of its target, PDC, from mitochondria to the nucleus thereby suppressing excessive nuclear acetyl Co-A generation and limiting epigenetic modifications of histones, leading to gene transcription that induces the barrier reparative AMφ population. These studies will employ a rigorous multi- omics approach (single-cell RNA-, ATAC-and Chip-sequencing) and functional assays in genetically altered mice including Rosa-CrebCxcxr3-ERT mice (in which CREB is conditionally deleted in monocytes/interstitial macrophages) to define the role of CREB transcriptional activity in generating the reparative AMφ population. Understanding how this barrier reparative AMɸ subset is generated should make it possible to enhance differentiation of this subset during injury by pharmacological or genetic means, thereby reducing the mortality of ALI and related conditions.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2719,379,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01CA258827-03,Longitudinal Spatial-Nonspatial Decision Support for Competing Outcomes in Head and Neck Cancer Therapy,"Cancers that depend on the spatial location of the disease affect all ethnicities and age groups, accounting for significant mortality and therapy-related side effects. In one instance, over 50,000 new cases of head and neck squamous carcinomas are diagnosed each year in the United States, leading to large, rich repositories of patient data. For each of these cases, oncologists need to anticipate survival, oncologic, and toxicity outcomes associated with treatment strategies in order to select a treatment which balances efficacy and toxicity. However, despite the wealth of data available, in the clinic decision support for cancer treatment is rudimentary and incorporates only a handful of patient characteristics, largely due to a lack of computational methodology and tools. We propose to construct a novel statistical and computational methodology for longitudinal and personalized treatment decisions over time, with specific application to head and neck cancer therapy planning. Simultaneous incorporation of complex factors---such as radiation dose location with respect to radiosensitive organs or patient reported side effects affecting quality of life---into treatment decisions over the course of cancer therapy requires the development of novel methodology. This methodology is revolutionary in that it is the first in the field to include both imaging and nonimaging data, while taking into account large-scale biological and clinical correlates. The approach is innovative through its leverage of big data repositories and through its unique blend of computational modeling principles from bioengineering and computer science. These methods allow us to incorporate diverse data types and model competing outcomes. From a clinical perspective, this integrative approach is novel in the field of cancer therapy. The resulting clinical decision support methodology will mark a significant advance in biomedical computing because it will be able to identify, for the first time, actionable timepoints for therapy and toxicity modification, based on a patient’s characteristics and quality of life indicators. The empirically-derived treatment decision support methodology developed in this project has the potential to directly improve the standard of care and the quality of life of surviving patients with a grave, often fatal and debilitating illness.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2371,342,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R01AI174538-01,Interplay between reverse transcription and host restriction,"Infectious agents have infected prokaryotes and eukaryotes throughout evolution. Indeed, there is co-evolution of organisms and their infectious agents, with development of protective responses in the hosts and adaptive countermeasures by the infectious agents. Infectious endemic retroviruses like murine leukemia virus (MLV) have existed in mice for millions of years and provide us with an outstanding model system to understand how mammalian hosts suppress virus replication and conversely, how viruses counteract this restriction. One system of viral restriction is conferred by the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic peptide 3 (A3) family of proteins, which are packaged into retroviruses in virion-producing cells and after infection of target cells, either block reverse transcription or deaminate deoxycytidine residues in single-stranded DNA, resulting in uracils and G-to-A mutations in the viral genome. The products of retrovirus reverse transcription (ssRNA, ssDNA and dsDNA) are also sensed by host nucleic acid sensors. Sensor binding to viral nucleic acid leads to the production of anti-viral cytokines and chemokines, such as type I interferons, which “warns” surrounding cells to arm themselves against infection by producing proteins such as A3. These host anti-viral events are believed to occur largely in the cytoplasm, where A3 proteins and many host sensors are believed to function. Retroviruses enter cells when the viral and host membranes fuse and capsids are deposited in the cytoplasm. Reverse transcription initiates from within the capsid and capsid dissociation and reverse transcription are mutually dependent; because DNA is more rigid than RNA, without capsid dissociation, reverse transcription cannot proceed and conversely, the generation of DNA facilitates capsid dissociation. The reverse transcription complex not only consists of viral RNA, DNA and the viral proteins reverse transcriptase and integrase, but viral capsid and other proteins such as the MLV protein p12, which is needed for tethering of the proviral DNA to host chromatin to achieve integration. Recently, there has been much debate as to whether reverse transcription occurs solely in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus or both. Our lab pioneered the use of in vivo mouse models to study how A3 proteins restrict retrovirus infection and has used A3 and nucleic acid sensor knockout (KO) mice and genetically engineered animals that express human A3 proteins in these studies. Our data, based on our analysis of A3 KO mice and cells, suggest that the initial step occurs in the cytoplasm but that reverse transcription may also occur in the cytoplasm. With these mouse models, we have the tools to carry out in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies to determine how A3-mediated restriction and sensing of reverse transcripts are integrated with reverse transcription and nuclear entry for MLV and its natural host, the mouse. To accomplish this, we propose 3 aims, that will determine: I. Where in the cells APOBEC3 proteins block reverse transcription or deaminate viral DNA; II. What stage in reverse transcription and where in the cell the host base excision repair enzyme, UNG, removes uracil from APOBEC3G-deaminated viral DNA and the consequences of this for viral escape; III. Whether host sensing of viral nucleic acid takes place in the cytoplasm, nucleus or both compartments. Determination of when and where these events occur is critical to understanding how retroviruses, including HIV, evade host immunity and the identification of which steps are likely to be the best targets for interventional therapies at the early stages of infection.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,3673,560,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R35GM131707-05,Control of cell proliferation and differentiation by the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pathway,"Inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor pathway is an early obligatory event in human cancer. One of the key targets of the Rb pathway is the family of E2F transcription factors, which regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Overlapping and redundant functions of mammalian members of the E2F and Rb tumor suppressor protein (pRB) families is a major hurdle in identification of their in vivo function. Model organisms such as Drosophila provide attractive alternatives to complement studies in mammalian systems due to high conservation of the Rb pathway and the amenability of flies to genetic analysis. Our research program is aimed at addressing two fundamental questions: what are the essential functions of the Rb pathway in development, and how do Rb pathway mutations affect different cell types in the tissue? To address these questions, we are using genetic, genomic and single-cell RNA-Seq approaches. We have identified adult skeletal muscle where E2F and Rb proteins regulate growth and myofibrillogenesis, to be important for viability. We will determine how the Rb pathway regulates gene expression and cellular metabolism during muscle development, and will investigate the systemic effects inferred by E2F deficiency in specific tissues such as adult skeletal muscle and the fat body. We have adapted Drop-Seq, a single-cell RNA-sequencing technology, to determine the effect of Rb pathway mutations in heterogeneous tissue. We have established the feasibility of this approach by building the first cell atlas of the Drosophila wild-type eye imaginal disc. Profiling of Rb mutants by Drop-Seq revealed elevated intracellular acidification in a small cell population that makes them uniquely sensitive to apoptosis. The link between apoptosis and acidification will be evaluated further. Among other questions to be addressed with Drop-seq is the investigation of why inactivation of the Hippo pathway induces dedifferentiation of Rb mutant photoreceptors.

5R01AI148148-04,Viral determinants in HSV virulence,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common cause of infectious blindness and viral encephalitis in the Western countries. Primary or recurrent infection can lead to severe disease, yet no licensed vaccine is available. HSV typically initiates infection in the epithelial cells of mucosa and spreads to sensory neurons where the virus establishes latency. Reactivation from latency occurs intermittently, which is a lifelong source for recurrent lesions. Although viral replication in the mucosa or penetration into the nervous system inflicts damages or inflammation, the disease mechanism is less clear. As a large DNA virus, HSV evokes antiviral responses through the innate immune pathways that regulate TANK-binding kinase 1, a key factor required to activate cytokine expression and autophagy in mammalian cells. Remarkably, while the interferon- stimulated gene (STING) drives the cytokine response the tripartite motif protein 23 (TRIM23) serves to mediate autophagy. Despite such regulatory control, HSV is able to compromise host restrictions, which depends on an HSV virulence factor γ134.5. A central hypothesis of this proposal is that HSV differentially reprograms host immunity, where a dynamic interplay between viral and cellular factors may determine HSV spread, virulence and inflammation. Current effort is directed to decipher mechanisms of HSV pathogenesis. Several aspects of HSV infection will be investigated in a multi- faceted approach. Accordingly, recombinant HSV will be generated to determine the nature of HSV interactions with the innate immune factors in epithelial and neuronal cells. This will dissect elements pertinent to viral interference of the nucleic acid sensing complexes and autophagy machineries. Furthermore, genetic studies will explore viral features relevant to ocular replication, spread and neurovirulence. In parallel, gene expression analysis will assesses ocular and neuoinflammation. Collectively, these studies will provide an insight into genetic determinants of HSV virulence, which may inform design of novel antiviral therapeutics or vaccines.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,2107,300,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL150848-04,Maternal Self-Regulation and Early Childhood Obesity,"PROJECT SUMMARY Young children are dependent on their parents to create family environments that support healthy weight, yet many parents do not consistently parent in ways that protect their children from obesity. Further, several interventions to improve parenting as a means to address early childhood obesity have struggled with parent engagement and adherence. In adults, poor self-regulation, or limitations in an individuals' capacity to regulate emotions, thoughts, and behavior, is a robust, yet modifiable, risk factor for obesity. Poor self-regulation may similarly interfere with parents' ability to parent in ways that support their children's healthy weight, but there are no robust data to directly support this conjecture. Further, while improving children's self-regulation has been identified as a promising method to address childhood obesity, we do not currently understand how parent and child self-regulation work together to impact children's growth. This lack of information precludes us from identifying whether targeting child self-regulation alone, parent self-regulation alone, or both together, may be the most effective means to prevent or treat childhood obesity. Our long-term goal is to identify strategies to sustainably improve parents' use of practices that support children's healthy weight. The objective of this study is to identify the interrelationships between mothers' self-regulation, their weight-related parenting practices, child self-regulation, and child adiposity from ages 3 through 5, a critical period for preventing the onset of long-term obesity. Our central hypothesis is that poor self-regulation impedes mothers' engagement in parenting practices that support children's healthy weight, leading to excessive gains in adiposity among young children. We also expect that in families where both mothers and children have poor self-regulation, mothers have even greater difficulty engaging in effective weight-related parenting, and children will experience the most rapid gains in adiposity. To test this central hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective cohort study enrolling a socio-demographically diverse sample of 300 mother/child dyads, collecting data 3 times over 2.5 years to address the following specific aims: (1) Identify relationships between mothers' self-regulation and weight-related parenting practices, (2) Identify relationships between mothers' self-regulation and changes in child adiposity, and (3) Identify how child self-regulation modifies relationships between mothers' self- regulation, weight-related parenting, and child adiposity. This project is conceptually innovative in its focus on mothers' self-regulation, its recognition of the dyadic interactions between mothers and children, and the use of rigorous methods to measure self-regulation and parenting. This research is significant because it will elucidate when, how, and among whom deficits in mothers' self-regulation contribute to their young children's obesity risk. There are known strategies to improve self-regulation and enhance behavior change among adults with poor self-regulation. Findings will provide essential guidance for the development of novel intervention approaches to target mothers' self-regulation as a mechanism to prevent and treat childhood obesity.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3321,456,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

7R01DK124469-06,Efficacy of sipIT Intervention for Increasing Urine Output in Patients with Urolithiasis,"Project Summary Kidney stones affect an estimated 8.8% of American adults and direct medical costs exceed $10 billion annually. Five-year recurrence rates for stones have been as high as 40% and a standard guideline for prevention is to increase fluid intake enough to produce > 2.5 L of urine daily. Meeting these guidelines reduces stone recurrence rates by 50-60% yet patients’ adherence to fluid intake guidelines is commonly below 50%. Usual care for preventing a recurrence involves education about increasing fluid intake and dietary changes; however, the low adherence rate indicates that many patients would benefit from additional support in adhering to fluid intake guidelines. The long-term goal of this research is to reduce the recurrence of painful and costly stones by improving patient adherence to fluid intake guidelines (secondary prevention). Digital technology offers the promise of increasing reach and supporting treatment adherence but, to date, that promise has not been fully realized in clinical trials of digital tools for supporting treatment adherence. In a series of six preliminary studies, we engaged patients in developing and testing a context-sensitive digital tool called sipIT, a just-in-time adaptive intervention to promote fluid intake and increase urine output. We learned that patients are open to using digital tools provided those tools are integrated with their lifestyle and sensitive to the changing contexts of their lives. The resulting intervention, sipIT, incorporates a novel semi-automated tracking system to trigger smartphone notifications with context-sensitive reminders to drink. The reminder system was informed by contemporary theories of habit formation to support behavior change in the eventual absence of the technology. In this application, we propose to answer question, “Does sipIT increase 24-hour urine output more than usual care over a 3-month period?” Urine output was selected as a proximal surrogate endpoint based on clinical guidelines for preventing recurrence of kidney stones. The specific aims of this project are (1) to evaluate the efficacy of sipIT vs usual care for increasing urine output in patients with a history of kidney stones, and (2) to identify biological and behavioral moderators of intervention effects on urine output (heterogeneity of treatment effects). We propose a two-arm randomized controlled trial to achieve these aims. Patients will receive either usual care + sipIT (intervention group) or usual care alone (control group). We will evaluate 24-hour urine output, urine supersaturations, and fluid intake habit strength at baseline and 1, 3, and 12 months after intervention. If successful, this research will lead to a cost-effective intervention that leverages consumer technology so it can be scaled for dissemination and implementation in clinical practice to reduce the burden and cost of stones. It advances NIDDK goals of preventing noncancerous urologic diseases and may be applied to support other dehydration-related health concerns (e.g., urinary tract infections, cognitive performance, heat stress, post-surgical hospital readmissions).",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3158,465,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R01AI183620-01,Role of the Hippo pathway in scleroderma pathogenesis,"Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a multi-system fibrotic disease characterized by hard, thickened (fibrotic) skin and involvement of multiple internal organs, significantly impacting morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The pathogenesis of SSc is complex, with contributions from genetic predisposition, striking female predominance, associated vascular alterations (vasculopathy), immune system dysregulation, and aberrant tissue fibrosis. Using single-cell sequencing, we have observed that both myofibroblasts and endothelial cells undergoing endothelial-mesenchymal transition (endo-MT) are the primary source of type I collagen in SSc skin and primarily interact with a subset of myeloid cells (LAMP3+ dendritic cells. We further identified Hippo signaling, an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway implicated in female-biased autoimmunity through the vestigial like 3 (VGLL3) transcriptional co-regulator, through both direct inhibition and siRNA targeting, as an upstream regulator of both fibroblast-to-myofibroblast and endothelial-to-endo-MT transition in SSc skin. This forms the basis of our central hypotheses that LAMP3+ DC – stromal cell interactions drive myofibroblast and endo- MT transition underlying fibrosis in SSc skin through modulation of Hippo signaling. We will address this hypothesis through three specific aims, with aim 1 to mechanistically dissect the role of the Hippo-signaling pathway in both endo-MTs and myofibroblasts, aim 2 to assess the role of the sex-biased transcriptional co- factor VGLL3, which regulates the Hippo pathway at the nuclear level, and aim 3 to address LAMP3+ DCs, which secrete pro-inflammatory mediators and is the primary immune cell subsets interacting with Endo-MTs and myofibroblast in SSc skin. This proposal will address a novel pathway in SSc pathogenesis, assess cross-talk with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic immune function, and assess the contribution of the sex-biased regulator VGLL3 in the process. Thus, this work may add to our understanding of SSc pathogenesis and the biological processes that drive the marked female bias observed in SSc.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2126,293,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01LM013894-04,A scalable service to improve health care quality through precision audit and feedback,"All health care delivery organizations measure care quality and outcomes, increasingly via electronic clinical quality measures 1 and dashboards 2,3. However, these organizations lack evidence-based strategies for putting their quality and outcome data to work to improve performance 4,5. The most common approach is audit and feedback (A&F), the delivery of clinical performance summaries to providers, which demonstrates potential for large effects on clinical practice 6–8. But A&F too often produces negligible effects 5,9, creating little more than distraction for providers who are fatigued by information chaos 9–11. As currently implemented, A&F is a blunt, “one size fits most” intervention. Each provider in a care setting typically receives identical metrics in a common format, despite a growing recognition that “precisionizing” interventions holds significant promise to improve their impact 12–15. A precision approach to A&F would prioritize display of information in the single metric that, for each recipient, carries the highest value for improving performance, such as when the metric's level drops below a peer benchmark or minimum standard for the first time, revealing an actionable performance gap 16–19. Furthermore, precision A&F would employ an optimal message format (including framing and visual displays 20–24), based on what is known about the recipient and the intended gist meaning being communicated, to improve message interpretation while reducing cognitive processing burden 25–28. Well- established psychological principles, frameworks, and theoretical mechanisms provide a knowledge base to achieve precision A&F 16–19,29–33. From an informatics perspective, precision A&F requires a knowledge-based system that uses psychological theory at its core, but which enables mass customization by giving precedence to configurable knowledge about recipients at the group and individual levels. A precision A&F service employs this knowledge as requirements (necessary characteristics for message acceptability) and preferences (the relative importance of message characteristics) to generate messages that are more likely than a “one size fits most” report to positively influence clinical decision-making and practice. An equally important informatics challenge is to enable widespread improvement through a service for precision A&F at scale. A scalable precision A&F service must function as infrastructure compatible with a wide range of computing environments and supporting a wide range of clinical domains. In his previous NLM K-award, the principal investigator developed and tested a prototype knowledge-based system for precision A&F in email messages in anesthesia care. Preliminary data show that provider preferences are not uniform, suggesting that a platform for computable knowledge is necessary to support scalable precision A&F. The Knowledge Grid platform, developed at the University of Michigan, has been shown to support “precisionizing” for clinical decision support systems 34–36. Based on our prior work, the proposed project will advance the creation of more general services for precision A&F, applying the service in anesthesia care as a demonstration domain.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3220,455,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01MH125857-04,Testing Adaptive Interventions to Improve PTSD Treatment Outcomes in Federally Qualified Health Centers,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects 6% of U.S. adults, yet is left untreated in 70% of affected individuals and up to 85% of low-income individuals. One third of the nation’s low-income individuals are treated in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which do not have the capacity to provide all their patients with first-line, evidence-based treatments for PTSD such as Prolonged Exposure (PE). To address this problem, the study team has developed a low-intensity intervention (PTSD Coach) and a medium-intensity intervention (PE for Primary Care: PE-PC) that effectively treat PTSD in low- resource settings. However, some patients will still require high-intensity treatments (e.g., Full PE) for sustained clinical benefit. Thus, there is a critical need to develop adaptive, stepped-care models to treat PTSD in FQHCs by combining efficacious treatments, based on response to initial lower-cost strategies. The long- term goal of this line of research is to improve access to efficacious PTSD treatments by implementing empirically-based stepped-care behavioral interventions in low-resource domestic settings. The overall objective in this proposal is to develop a stepped-care intervention for PTSD using a Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART). The central hypothesis is that beginning with a low- or medium- intensity PTSD intervention and then titrating intensity based on early indications of response will result in clinically-significant PTSD symptom reduction with parsimony of resources. The rationale is that stepped-care interventions for PTSD are scalable and less costly than static treatments, thereby improving efficiency. To accomplish the objective, this project will employ a SMART design with 430 adults with PTSD in six FQHCs. Participants will be initially randomized to PTSD Coach or PE-PC. After four weeks, early responders will step down to lower frequency interaction within their current treatment strategy. Slow responders will be re- randomized to either continue their current treatment strategy or step up to Full PE for eight weeks. The specific aims are to: (1) Test the effectiveness of initiating treatment with PE-PC versus PTSD Coach in reducing PTSD symptoms at 3 months (endpoint), 6-month follow-up and 9-month follow-up, and (2) Test the effectiveness of second-stage tactics (continue or step up to Full PE) for slow responders. Exploratory aims are to (A) Identify the optimal stepped-care treatment sequence; (B) Conduct cost-effectiveness analysis; (C) Identify key mediators/moderators of treatment response; and (D) Prepare for future implementation through process evaluation. This project will contribute to the field an empirically-based stepped-care intervention for PTSD. This contribution is significant because it will improve clinical practice for PTSD by establishing an effective treatment sequence that can be delivered in a scalable, sustainable manner. This proposal is innovative because it will use novel methodologies to help shift the current clinical paradigm of PTSD treatment from fixed, static, and hard-to-access treatment strategies to a dynamic, adaptive, and accessible approach.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3237,465,4.0,True,True,0.8,phase2_nih,,,
5F99CA284256-02,Inter-organellar communication in metabolic reprogramming of colorectal cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Colorectal cancers (CRC) are characterized as having a hierarchical organization requiring proliferating and de-differentiated stem cells to maintain tumor growth and progression. Cellular plasticity underlying colorectal cancer is essential for a process which occurs following selective pressures of the tumor microenvironment and chemotherapeutics. The colonic tumor microenvironment is characterized by extreme hypoxia due to the anoxic lumen. Hypoxia promotes metabolic rewiring, and such processes are utilized by cancer cells to support biosynthesis, cell survival and dynamic alteration in cell fates. A critical feature of cellular metabolism is organellar interaction and coordination, yet how these contribute to CRC plasticity, survival, progression and treatment response are unclear. Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS) are the most abundant inter-organellar interaction. I generated a panel of ERMCS reporter CRC cell lines, and through unbiased high content imaging and CRISPR screens, I have identified essential mechanisms required for ER- mitochondrial interactions in CRC. Moreover, I show a key role of tumor hypoxia in modulating ERMCS. Hypoxia inhibited mitochondrial complex III and IV to decrease ERMCS. Treating cells with the mitochondrial electron carrier, coenzyme (CoQ) rescued ERMCS suppression following hypoxia. I hypothesize that tumor hypoxia regulates ER-mitochondrial contacts (ERMCS) by altering mitochondrial respiration and CoQ redox for metabolic adaptation and survival. In aim 1 (F99 phase), I will focus on identifying the molecular mechanism of hypoxia dependent ERMCS inhibition and expand into in vivo models with our novel ERMCS reporter mouse model. During the K00 phase, I will apply knowledge gained during graduate school in cancer metabolism and organellar interaction to an independent postdoctoral project. The plasticity of colorectal tumor epithelium depends on integration of organellar functions to sustain metabolic demands. Therefore, my goal as a postdoctoral fellow is to understand the dynamic changes and requirement for organellar interactions and metabolic compartmentalization during cell fates alterations in CRC. I plan to use genetic murine and primary patient organoid models of CRC, volumetric electron microscopy, in vivo organellar metabolomics, and functional CRISPR screens to answer these questions. Lastly, in addition to the proposed studies, this training plan includes activities important for career development, mentorship, networking, and scientific communication to prepare me for successful transition to a postdoctoral fellowship and my career as an independent investigator studying cancer metabolism.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2727,372,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01MH132656-02,A Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation RCT of Virtual Interview Training for Autistic Transition-Age Youth,"Project Summary: Pre-employment transition services is federally-mandated by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (2014) to help prepare autistic transition-age youth for the workforce prior to existing high school. However, there are few evidence-based practices implemented within pre-employment transition services, which contribute to low employment rates among autistic transition-age youth. A limitation of pre-employment transition services is the job interview component, which utilizes teacher-led role-play training that lacks empirical validation, is resource-intensive, and does not adhere to best practices to train sustainable changes in behavior (e.g., repeated practice, scaffolding, token economy). Moreover, the autism community as voice the need for better job interview preparation. To fill this training need, our team (via R34 MH111531) partnered with the autism community to adapt Virtual Reality Job interview Training (VR-JIT, an internet-delivered job interview simulator with four levels of automated feedback with elearning job interview content) to meet the needs of autistic transition-age youth (now called Virtual Interview Training for Transition Age Youth (VIT)). Our subsequent randomized controlled trial demonstrated several aspects of VIT feasibility, including delivery by local teachers at five schools, training teachers as VIT implementers, and completing the pilot RCT (i.e., recruitment, enrollment, study completers). The results of this pilot study demonstrated that VIT was initially effective at improving job interview skills, job interview anxiety, and competitive employment within 6 months of completing VIT. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to conduct a fully-powered trial to evaluate the impact of VIT across approximately 16 schools via a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation RCT. Our specific aims are to 1) Evaluate whether pre-employment transition services (ETS) with VIT, as compared to ETS with an active control intervention (i.e., job interview didactics/elearning with a series of 3-5 minutes videos of employed autistic adults talking about their career pathways), enhances employment outcomes; 2) Evaluate mechanisms of employment outcomes and psychological distress by nine months post- randomization; and 3) Conduct a multilevel, mixed-method process evaluation to assess initial implementation outcomes (i.e., facilitators, barriers, scalability, and affordability of VIT implementation).",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2485,336,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F32HD106679-03,Local Economic Conditions and Patterns of Family Instability and Complexity,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The economy and the family—two social institutions that strongly affect health and well-being in the US—have undergone profound change in the last half-century. The economy changed through the stagnation of male wages, declining manufacturing jobs and rising service sector employment, and increases in inequality. Simultaneously, US families experienced increases in instability (repeated changes in parental marital/union status) and complexity (families that exist outside the typical nuclear family structure) through the late 1990s, such that approximately 40% of children currently live in complex families. Local economic conditions, like income inequality, are linked with singular family formation behaviors, like nonmarital births. Yet, the relationship between local economic conditions and family instability and complexity remains unknown. The objective of the proposed research project is to assess how local economic conditions— unemployment rates, wage stagnation, occupational structure, and income inequality—are associated with patterns of family instability and complexity, identifying how these associations developed over historical time and vary by social location. Aim 1 will establish contemporary (1997-2017) patterns of family instability and complexity by local economic conditions. Aim 2 will assess how changes in local economic conditions are linked with changes in family instability and complexity over historical time, comparing three periods: 1969- 1975 (early family change), 1976-1996 (rapid family change), 1997-2017 (family change plateau). Aim 3 will assess variation by race and educational attainment in the associations between local economic conditions and family instability and complexity. The PI will use advanced quantitative methods—sequence analysis, demographic decomposition, spatial data analysis, and causal inference techniques—to address these aims, and the use of nationally-representative data will produce generalizable results. Collectively, the aims will generate rigorous evidence on (1) whether and how local economic conditions affect patterns of family structure change, and (2) which children are most likely to be exposed to family instability and complexity. These findings are relevant to population health because family instability and complexity compromise the health and well-being of parents and children. This research project is part of a broader, 3-year postdoctoral training fellowship at a top research university, supervised by a team of mentors with expertise in family demo- graphy and economic inequality. The training plan comprises: (1) substantive training in family demography, economic conditions, and economic inequality; (2) advanced quantitative methods training that will facilitate a career in population health-relevant research; and (3) professional development through increased research independence, grant writing, conference presentations, and networking. The training plan will prepare the PI to conduct innovative research on how social and economic conditions shape family structure trajectories across the lifespan, which has consequences for population dynamics and population health.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3205,430,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01EY034479-02,Vision Impairment in the National Health and Aging Trends Study,": At least 14 million people in the U.S. are blind or living with a vision impairment (VI), and the number affected is projected to double by 2050 due to aging and growth of the U.S. population. The majority of those with VI and blindness are older adults aged ≥65 years. Particularly in later life, VI is thought to be associated with a host of adverse outcomes, including dementia, admission to a long-term care facility, and even mortality. Nonetheless, rigorous and generalizable research on how risk factors impact vision and eye health, and how vision influences late-life outcomes has been limited due to a lack of data that: (i) is longitudinal; (ii) is representative of the U.S. population; (iii) contains objective assessments of visual function; and (iv) samples older adults. In the proposed project, we will address this barrier using newly collected vision data from the NIH-funded National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), an ongoing nationally representative panel study of >7,000 adults aged ≥65 years. In 2021, NHATS began annual measurement of distance and near visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. In Aim 1 of the proposed study, we use NHATS data to provide the first-ever estimates on the incidence of VI and blindness at the national level, as well as national prevalence estimates. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the longitudinal influence of risk factors on vision health. To do so, we will utilize individual-level indicators of risk factors from NHATS and neighborhood level-indicators from the NIH-funded National Neighborhood Data Archive that is linked to NHATS. In Aim 3, we will investigate the longitudinal impact of VI and blindness on the development of dementia, placement in long-term care, and all-cause mortality. In a sub-aim, we will use a longitudinal mediation model to test whether the influence of key risk factors on adverse late-life outcomes is mediated by vision and eye health. To date, it has not been possible to carry out nationally representative studies on the associations of VI with risk factors and key late-life outcomes due to the lack of longitudinal and objectively measured visual function data in a national sample. Thus, the proposed studies will address critical scientific gaps. This proposal is also highly responsive to the National Eye Institute’s new 5-year Strategic Plan, including: (i) to gather current epidemiologic data; (ii) to support research at the nexus of risk factors and the healthcare system; and (iii) to explore research encompassing comorbidities. Epidemiological estimates will be made publicly available, and all study findings will be widely disseminated to maximize the impact of these studies on public health and to optimize vision and overall health and wellbeing for an aging U.S. population.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2795,444,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5F31NS127551-02,PRC1-dependent H2A Monoubiquitination During Human Corticogenesis,"PROJECT SUMMARY Intellectual disability affects 2-3% of the population in industrialized nations, with genetic causes accounting for approximately half of these cases. Whole genome sequencing has led to the discovery of several novel pathogenic variants underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. Among these variants, proteins involved in chromatin post-translational modifications are highly represented. Variants in the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), the primary catalyst of histone 2A monoubiquitination (H2AUb1), illustrate this trend. RING1 and RNF2 are paralogues that serve as the constituent E3 ubiquitin ligase of PRC1, and missense variants in these genes that blunt H2AUb1 catalysis are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disability, and early onset schizophrenia. The goal of this proposal is to understand how pathogenic RING1 variants lead to disease genetically and molecularly. To explore the role of PRC1- dependent H2AUb1 in the context of human corticogenesis, we have generated isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines harboring pathogenic variants in RING1 and subjected them to neural differentiation to generate 3D cerebral organoids. Previous studies suggest that PRC1-dependent H2AUb1 has roles in transcriptional repression and double strand break repair. Consistent with these previous reports, our preliminary data demonstrates that the RING1G284A/G284A variant diminishes global H2AUb1 levels, leads to increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes and decreased growth in cerebral organoids, and disrupts double strand break repair in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Aim 1 will explore the genetic mechanism of RING1 pathogenic variants, as experiments will shed light onto whether pathogenesis is due to lost activity of wild type RING1 or due to a dominant negative effect of the mutant allele. Aim 2 will evaluate the molecular mechanism by which pathogenic RING1 variants cause microcephaly. Experiments will evaluate NPCs and organoids differentiated from hESCs harboring RING1 pathogenic variants for defects in DNA damage repair, increased rates of apoptosis, and the ability to silence transcription at sites of DNA damage. Mechanistic insights learned from these experiments will shed light onto the role of PRC1-dependent H2AUb1 in proliferating NPCs and in maintaining genome integrity more broadly. In addition, the results of these studies will inform future efforts to devise therapeutic strategies to restore these functions in individuals with pathogenic RING1 variants.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2582,361,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DK126451-03,Wnt Pathway Regulation of Gastric Stem Cell Function,"PROJECT SUMMARY This resubmission of a new R01 application proposes to define mechanisms of gastric stem cell regulation, investigating the role of Wnt signaling to maintain tissue homeostasis and to promote epithelial cell proliferation in the stomach. Our proposed studies are directly relevant to human disease, focusing on mechanisms of gastric polyp formation in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is a genetic disorder resulting from germline APC gene mutations that dysregulate Wnt signaling, with extreme gastrointestinal (GI) proliferative disease resulting from Wnt promotion of stem cell proliferation. Although Wnt is well known to regulate GI stem cells, questions remain regarding sensitivity to Wnt dysregulation in different regions of the GI tract. Colonic manifestations in FAP patients are extreme, with aggressive disease characterized by early adenoma and cancer development, which commonly leads to colectomy at a young age. The consequences of Wnt dysregulation in gastric stem cells is less well understood, although polyp, adenoma and cancer development are enhanced in the FAP patient stomach. Notably, almost all FAP patients exhibit frequent hyperproliferative polyps localized to the proximal fundic/corpus region of the stomach, while, in contrast, the distal antral/pylorus region of the stomach is relatively spared from these polyps and develops more occasional adenomatous growths. The basis for the regional effect of FAP mutations on corpus vs. antral stem cells and gastric tissue responses is unknown. To address this important question, this project focuses on defining Wnt regulation of gastric stem cells to uncover the differential effects of pathway activation in the proximal vs. distal stomach. We will pursue the mechanisms of FAP polyp formation in the stomach by functional and genetic analysis of gastric polyp and non-polyp organoids and tissues from a biobank of human FAP gastric tissue samples that will be built as a component of this study. Human FAP organoid studies will be complemented by mouse genetic, pharmacologic and organoid models to gain deeper mechanistic insight into regional Wnt regulation of gastric stem cells. The studies are framed by the “Just Right Hypothesis” which defines differential sensitivities along the GI tract based on region-specific stem cell responses to different levels of Wnt activation. Together the proposed studies will determine how dysregulated Wnt signaling leads to differential gastric epithelial cell proliferation and polyp formation in proximal vs. distal stomach. This information will establish a scientific framework to help define the gastric manifestations in FAP patients. In addition, the studies will provide functional insights to develop a deeper understanding of Wnt pathway regulation of gastrointestinal stem cells. Furthermore, understanding mechanisms of Wnt pathway regulation of gastric stem cell function is important to refine strategies to propagate adult stem cells in culture for regenerative therapies as well as to develop diagnostic criteria and potential therapies for gastric hyperproliferative diseases.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3156,459,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R01DA058029-01A1,Improving Perioperative Care for Patients with Opioid Tolerance,"In the United States, nearly 1 in 6 adults filled an opioid prescription in the past year and 10 million adults are opioid tolerant. Compared with opioid naïve patients, individuals with opioid tolerance experience greater challenges in managing acute pain especially after having surgery and poorer outcomes following surgical care. For example, opioid exposure before surgery has been shown to lead to greater rates of opioid consumption after surgery. Further, patients with opioid tolerance frequently encounter high-risk prescribing practices and delays in returning to their usual prescriber after surgery, as well as greater rates of morbidity and mortality after surgery. Evidence-based care pathways have been developed to improve opioid prescribing before and after surgery for opioid-naïve patients, but little is known about the postoperative needs of patients with opioid tolerance. Specifically, important knowledge gaps exist regarding the appropriate amount of opioids to prescribe after surgery, best practices in coordinating opioid therapy during the perioperative period, and the effectiveness of care coordination pathways to prevent high-risk prescribing practices and optimize clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population. To address these gaps, we will prospectively capture patient-reported opioid use and pain outcomes among individuals with opioid tolerance undergoing common surgical procedures and develop a clinical care pathway to optimize outcomes across a large network of hospitals in the state of Michigan that are diverse with respect to geography and case mix. In 2016, we established the Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network (OPEN), a federal and state funded quality improvement program focused on developing and disseminating best practices in surgical opioid prescribing and pain management for opioid-naïve patients. In this proposal, we will extend this work to examine patient-reported pain outcomes and opioid prescribing practices after surgery among opioid tolerant patients in order to calibrate current prescribing guidelines for common general surgery procedures (Aim 1). We will then conduct qualitative interviews with surgical patients who have opioid tolerance; their providers; and healthcare leaders. This data will inform the development of a clinical care pathway for perioperative pain management for patients with opioid tolerance (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a prospective randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of the care pathway on coordinating care and reducing high-risk prescribing practices after surgery, length of stay, and readmissions, as well as optimizing patient-reported pain (Aim 3). We hypothesize that implementation of the care pathway will increase alignment with guideline-concordant prescribing without adversely impacting patient-centered outcomes. Given the high prevalence of individuals with opioid tolerance undergoing surgery each year in the United States, interventions to reduce high-risk prescribing practices, adverse postoperative events, and optimize postoperative pain management will lead to safer perioperative care.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3133,435,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

Implementation of tight glycemic control has reduced the frequency of devastating complications of T1D such as early death, blindness and amputation. Women and men with T1D face new challenges including cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction and urological disorders. UroEDIC, an ancillary study examining urological complications in the DCCT/EDIC cohort, combines over 25 years of detailed medical information and >90% participation in urological symptom assessment annually since 2010, making it the longest running most extensive urological evaluation of persons with T1D. The previous funding cycle identified lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary incontinence (UI) as urological disorders in men and women with T1D with the highest prevalence and greatest impact on quality of life (QOL). By linking powerful longitudinal urological phenotypes with extensive clinical and laboratory data of the DCCT/EDIC, we can substantially deepen our understanding of diabetes associated urinary complications. Preliminary analyses show that although many patients develop a fixed state of LUTS or UI, many others move in and out of the state over time. Our overall hypothesis is that metabolic, autonomic and epithelial dysfunctions are associated with persistent and reversible subphenotypes of LUTS and UI in men and women with diabetes. Observations also indicate bladder overactivity in both genders is increasing in this cohort. However, there is a lack of understanding of the burden and impact of other diabetic bladder problems, particularly diabetic cystopathy, classically described as decreased bladder sensation, poor contractility and high residual urine volume. The goals of UroEDIC Bladder, therefore, are to 1) characterize the full spectrum of bladder dysfunction in T1D, 2) create risk models that explain the progression and remission of LUTS/UI, and 3) identify mechanistic themes underpinning the persistence of these symptoms. The specific aims of this project are designed to incorporate newly proposed and available longitudinal data on bladder retention, autonomic dysfunction and novel transcriptional signatures with the full range of DCCT/EDIC measurements to gain deeper insight into the longitudinal patterns and mechanisms of LUTS/UI and comprehensively characterize diabetic bladder dysfunction in T1D.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2813,397,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5R00DK123395-04,GPRASP family as novel regulators in hematopoietic stem cells,"Project Summary Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) represents the only curative therapy for most hematologic disease including leukemia. HSCT requires donor HSCs to engage with the proper supporting niche, survive, proliferate, and differentiate into mature blood lineages. Recent studies suggest that “stress hematopoiesis”, including that which occurs post-HSCT, is subject to distinct regulation compared steady-state hematopoiesis. A better understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate transplanted HSCs and their engraftment is necessary to improve HSCT, especially in situations where transplant is limited by small cell numbers (e.g. cord blood) or potentially compromised by ex vivo manipulation (e.g. gene therapy). Towards this, the main goal of this project is to identify and characterize novel key intrinsic regulators of HSCT. My work reveals high expression of multiple GPRASPs (G-Protein Coupled Receptor Associated Sorting Proteins) (e.g. Gprasp1 and Gprasp2) in HSCs, relative to downstream progenitors. I have also found that both GPRASP1 and GPRASP2 act as negative regulators of HSCT. Gprasp-deficient HSCs present enhanced homing, survival and quiescence during transplant. This phenotype appears dependent on Cxcr4, a master regulator of HSCs function, whose sequence contains a putative GASP-binding motif. Indeed, ectopic Cxcr4 enhances HSC homing, survival and quiescence during transplant, phenocopying loss of Gprasp1 or Gprasp2. Further, my preliminary studies show that, upon Gprasp1 or Gprasp2 loss, CXCR4 is stabilized and accumulates on HSCs, sensitizing them to SDF-1. CXCR4 has also been implicated in regulating cell-to-cell contact between B-cell progenitors and stroma cells. Interesting, my recent data suggests that GPRASP loss may also perturb B-cell production by blocking the differentiation of lymphoid progenitors. Finally, although HSCs as a population are highly enriched for Gprasp1 and Gprasp2 expression, my recent analyses of single cell gene expression data and single HSCs by immunofluorescence reveals that the expression of these genes is heterogeneous amongst individual HSCs. This differential expression corresponds with distinct gene expression profiles (e.g. stemness, cell cycle, B-cell differentiation). Although clonal analyses have revealed that even highly purified HSCs display diverse differentiation potential, the molecular regulation of this functional heterogeneity is currently poorly understood. Thus, I hypothesize that multiple GPRASP family members regulate HSC transplantation and B-cell differentiation, and correlate with HSC functional heterogeneity. The mentored phase of this proposal will occur at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, under Dr. Shannon McKinney-Freeman. In the independent phase, I will confirm and extend my studies of the molecular link between GPRASPs and CXCR4 in HSCT and B-cell differentiation, as well as exploit novel molecular reporters to refine HSC functional heterogeneity. The institutional resources and academic environment and the planned courses outlined in my proposal will ensure my successful transition to independence.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3168,435,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R35GM154671-01,Glucocorticoids in short- and long-term critical illness outcomes,"Because of the high mortality, morbidity, and health care costs associated with critical illness, identifying biological mechanisms that can be targeted to improve critical illness outcomes is an important public health priority. Glucocorticoid treatment has been frequently studied in critically ill populations and can improve short- term survival as well as long-term mental health outcomes. Full realization of the therapeutic potential of glucocorticoids in critical illness is hampered by gaps in our understanding of its mechanisms of action and by glucocorticoid resistance, which limits its efficacy. Our future research program will focus on the theme of glucocorticoid mechanisms relevant to critical illness, with three main objectives. First, our prior work led us to hypothesize that glucocorticoids improve mental health outcomes by enhancing factual memories from the ICU. We will test this hypothesis in a population of sepsis survivors from our hospital. Second, we propose a novel hypothesis about the importance of brainstem glucocorticoid signaling in the maintenance of cardiovascular and immune homeostasis. We will test the role of glucocorticoid receptors in this specific brainstem area in the response to acute hypotensive and inflammatory challenges using the tools and skills that we have acquired for neural circuit interrogation. Finally, we propose to test a novel strategy to improve peripheral and central glucocorticoid sensitivity in collaboration with a new industry partner. Over the past five years I have positioned myself as a multidisciplinary leader across critical care, endocrinology, and neuroscience. My laboratory’s experience in running a translational research program at this interface will lead to the identification of specific, targetable mechanisms to improve critical illness outcomes. Alongside these research goals, I will continue my work as a mentor for the next generation of scientists and physician-scientists. Because of the translational importance of our work and the inclusivity of our environment, my lab has become a sought-after environment for scientific trainees. During this funding period I will continue to grow as a mentor and leader, cultivating a collaborative and diverse group that reflects and prepares the next generation of scientists.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2318,337,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HD108253-02,The impact of hormonal modulation on systemic inflammation and central sensitization,". Chronic pelvic pain remains a challenging condition to treat, in large part because underlying disease mechanisms are poorly understood. Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP) is a common form of CPP wherein the severity of disease is only weakly associated with the degree of pain experienced. While pelvic inflammation is a well-established contributing factor to EAPP, we propose that low-grade systemic inflammation also contributes to the disease state by promoting central nervous system (CNS) sensitization. Emerging evidence from our group and others suggests that low-grade systemic inflammation can promote multiple aspects of CNS sensitization including clinical manifestations (comorbid pain conditions, widespread pain), hypersensitivity to experimental stimuli, and altered brain functional connectivity in pelvic pain. While hormonal suppression is effective for many women, and acts in part by dampening estradiol-dependent pelvic inflammation, little is known about the relative contributions of low-grade systemic inflammation and CNS sensitization to EAPP. We propose to use the FDA-approved, gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor antagonist, elagolix, available in two dosages, as a mechanistic probe to assess the effects of pelvic and systemic inflammation on EAPP. The presence of robust dose-dependent effects on EAPP and its comorbid symptoms suggests to us that the higher dose also reduces CNS sensitization, possibly due to reduced systemic inflammation. To investigate this hypothesis, we will conduct a double-blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial in which 200 women with EAPP will be randomly assigned to low-dose (150mg daily) or high-dose (400mg daily) elagolix or placebo with evaluation of pain mechanism outcomes prior to and after treatment. We will focus on two common patient phenotypes – those with EAPP only and those with EAPP and widespread pain (1:1 recruitment). In Aim 1, we will first define the relationship between pelvic inflammation, systemic inflammation, and CNS sensitization using well-vetted neurobiological measures of CNS sensitization. We anticipate that systemic inflammation will be associated with CNS sensitization, while pelvic inflammation will not be. In Aim 2, we will identify dose-dependent changes in CNS sensitization as well as systemic and pelvic inflammation during hormonal suppression for EAPP through the above-described clinical trial. We anticipate that both dosages will improve pelvic inflammation, but that systemic inflammation and CNS sensitization will be improved on high-dose elagolix. We furthermore anticipate that those with widespread pain will be more likely to respond to high-dose elagolix. In an exploratory Aim 3, we will determine if baseline levels of pelvic and/or systemic inflammatory activity, as well as CNS sensitization, predict the response to elagolix. These studies are critical to develop alternative mechanistic models of pain promotion and relief in this vulnerable group of patients and will have implications for understanding hormonal contributions to the female preponderance of chronic pain syndromes.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3140,445,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
4K00NS129171-03,Assessing the efficacy of NIR therapy to modulate shared secondary injury mechanisms in a murine model of ischemic stroke and porcine model of TBI,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading health concern for both children and adults worldwide. Similarities between pig and human brain anatomy, development, and neuroinflammatory response have brought attention to the domestic pig as a highly promising model animal for studying age-specific responses to mechanical trauma. To date, I have quantified baseline behavioral data in healthy Yucatan minipigs. For the duration of the training period, I will conduct a battery of behavioral tests to identify changes in behavior and physiology in juvenile pigs following a closed-head impact procedure designed to model pediatric concussion. In the postdoctoral phase, I plan to develop expertise in the development of novel neurointervention strategies in large animal models. To facilitate transition to a lab where I will need to utilize state-of-the-art imaging techniques to validate the efficacy of my treatments, I will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an assessment tool to quantify changes in neural structure and function in brain-injured pigs.

5K08DK129719-03,Coordinated functions of ER quality control mechanisms in pancreatic islet α cells,"SUMMARY A central component of diabetes pathogenesis is dysregulated secretion of insulin and glucagon from b and α cells of the endocrine pancreas. Endocrine cells rely on protein quality control (QC) systems within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to clear misfolded proteins, maintain ER homeostasis and ensure hormone production. Misfolded proteins are removed in part through substrate-specific clearance by Sel1L-Hrd1 ER- associated degradation (ERAD), or bulk degradation of aggregates by autophagy. Our recent study showed that ERAD and autophagy regulate different aspects of β cell biology – maintenance of β cell identity and survival, respectively. Despite their shared importance in controlling glucose homeostasis, our understanding of α cell biology lags behind that of β cells. The mechanisms regulating ER homeostasis in (and thus, synthetic capacity of) α cells remain largely unexplored. To this end, mouse models lacking Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD or autophagy in α cells were characterized. Defective ERAD limited glucagon production and α cell mass, but did not impair systemic glucagon secretion in response to hypoglycemia. In contrast, defective autophagy in α cells disrupted ER homeostasis and impaired glucagon secretion in vivo. Intriguingly, our preliminary data points to potential crosstalk between these two QC machineries. Hence, this proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD and autophagy cooperate to ensure ER proteostasis in pancreatic α cells – which is critical for α cell identity, function and/or survival. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro genetic and pharmacologic approaches using mouse models, cell lines, and human islets, we will test the following Aims: (1) Demonstrate the pathophysiological importance of the interplay between ERAD and autophagy in α cells, and (2) Delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the crosstalk between ERAD and autophagy in α cells. This study will provide unprecedented insights into ER QC mechanisms in α cells, which may be harnessed to identify new therapeutic approaches to address α cell dysfunction in diabetes. This undertaking will build upon Dr. Reinert’s scientific expertise in developmental biology and physiology with training in two cutting-edge cell biology fields, ERAD and autophagy, with a focus on organelle crosstalk. Moreover, this study will strengthen Dr. Reinert’s technical skills by providing training in state-of-the-art cell biology techniques, thus paving a strong foundation for her future career as a physician scientist leading an interdisciplinary team studying islet cell biology and pathophysiology.

5F32CA260735-03,Targeting purine biosynthesis to radiosensitize glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive primary brain tumor and is uniformly fatal with a median survival of around 1.5 years. Like surgery and chemotherapy, radiation (RT) is a critical treatment for nearly every patient with GBM and has repeatedly improved patient survival in multiple randomized trials. Still, 80% of GBMs recur within the high dose RT field. Thus, there is a critical need to develop strategies to overcome GBM RT resistance to further improve patient outcomes. GBM cells exhibit profound cancer-specific metabolic abnormalities, including elevated purine synthesis, to fuel proliferation, invasion and survival. Using mice bearing intracranial orthotopic patient-derived brain tumors, my research has established that the metabolic phenotype of elevated purine synthesis also mediates resistance to RT in GBM by promoting the repair of RT-induced DNA damage. This purine-mediated RT resistance can be overcome by treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an FDA-approved and CNS-penetrant inhibitor of purine biosynthesis. In this research proposal I will determine how the RT response and purine synthesis regulate one another in GBM. By employing a variety of cutting-edge metabolomic techniques and patient-derived GBM models, I will 1) define the biosynthetic pathway GBMs use to generate purines, and 2) determine the RT response mechanism by which GBMs increase purine levels to resist RT-induced DNA damage. Findings from the experiments proposed here will expand our understanding of how tumors modulate metabolism to promote therapeutic resistance, inform how to combine metabolic inhibitors with standard therapies, and lay the mechanistic groundwork for clinical trials at the University of Michigan that targeting purine biosynthesis to augment RT in GBM patients.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,1809,263,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DK125792-03,Testing a very low-carbohydrate diet version of the Diabetes Prevention Program to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes,"One-third of U.S. adults have prediabetes and are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its devastating health consequences. The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) trial demonstrated that a resource- intensive, one-on-one program combining diet and physical activity changes, could reduce the 3-year risk of type 2 diabetes by 58% compared with usual care. Consequently, the DPP is considered one of the best examples of how a nutritional program can prevent disease, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others recommend the DPP as a first-line treatment for adults with prediabetes. The CDC’s National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) is an adaptation of the DPP trial curriculum, using group-based delivery. It teaches participants to follow a low-fat, calorie-restricted diet, as this was the prevailing dietary advice when the DPP trial was designed over 30 years ago. The NDPP is now available at >1,500 sites throughout the United States and reimbursed by Medicare and other payors. Yet, despite widespread availability, only 36% of participants achieve the program goal of ≥5% body weight loss and, when measured, HbA1c reduces on average less than 0.1%. We hypothesize that adapting the NDPP to teach a different dietary strategy—a very-low-carbohydrate diet (VLCD)—will increase the effectiveness of the NDPP as a tool for type 2 diabetes risk reduction. Carbohydrate intake is the strongest factor impacting post-prandial glycemia, and a VLCD—due to its ability to reduce glycemia, weight, and the need for anti-hyperglycemic medications—is now recommended by the American Diabetes Association for treatment of type 2 diabetes. To date, there are neither high-quality, randomized controlled trials testing how effective a VLCD is at reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes, nor randomized trials of VLCD versions of any DPP. To begin to fill this critical gap, our team has developed and pilot tested a VLCD version of the NDPP (VLC- NDPP), delivered by our CDC-recognized community partner, the National Kidney Foundation of Michigan. Our findings demonstrate that a VLC-NDPP is feasible and acceptable. We now propose to conduct a 12- month, 1:1, randomized trial that will assign 300 overweight or obese adults with prediabetes to either the standard NDPP or the VLC-NDPP. The primary outcome is glycemic control (measured by HbA1c), with secondary outcomes including body weight, body fat percentage, glycemic variability, and inflammation. We will also explore the barriers to and facilitators of glycemic control and dietary adherence using mixed methods. As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the understanding of personalized interventions continue to increase, there is a critical need to provide additional effective options for population-level type 2 diabetes prevention strategies. If the VLC-DPP shows promise, this trial would be a precursor to a multi-site trial with incidence of type 2 diabetes as the primary outcome.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3020,461,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DK123022-04,Manganese in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a family of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract that affect over 3 million Americans. While genetic background clearly plays a role, environmental factors, especially dietary nutrients, have been suspected as triggers to contribute to the disease development. Identifying the direct causal mechanisms by which genetics and dietary nutrients coordinately influence IBD susceptibility may provide direct utility in uncovering both how the disease develops and how it may be treated in the future. Although genetic factors appear to play relatively minor roles in IBD, there is one particular association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with IBD that showed up at the top of a recent genome-wide association screen in IBD: a common variant in the manganese transporter SLC39A8 (p.Ala391Thr). We and others have shown that this transporter is critical for the incorporation of manganese (Mn), a micronutrient required for many enzymatic activities. The SLC39A8 A391T variant was shown in vitro to have reduced Mn incorporating function, and we made similar observations independently. These revelations hint toward alterations in Mn levels caused by diet or genetics, as contributing factors for IBD. Yet, Mn deficiency has traditionally been rare in humans due to its various dietary sources. Mn is abundant in plant-based foods, including whole grains, rice, nuts, and leafy vegetables, whereas animal-based foods lack this nutrient. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed >40% reduction in dietary Mn consumption in the past 15 years due to a Western diet characterized by high intakes of red meats, high fat foods, and refined grains. This data is congruent with the increasing incidence of IBD, and it supports an inverse relationship between nutritional Mn levels and IBD patients. However, we still have not established if there is a causal role of Mn in IBD and the mechanism by which Mn contributes to IBD. This project will define functional insight into the roles of dietary Mn and SLC39A8 that maintain intestinal health, thereby advancing research into the etiology of IBD. Our findings will pave the way for future research in individuals at high risk of IBD to provide dietary recommendations and therapeutic targets.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2354,358,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F31CA265085-02,Regulation and role of fibroblast-derived interleukin-33 in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly deadly disease with a five-year survival rate of only 10%. The bulk of the PDA tumor volume is composed of a reactive fibroinflammatory tumor microenvironment that assists in the growth and maintenance of the tumor. The highly immunosuppressive nature of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment is also responsible, in part, for the continued inefficacy of immunotherapy treatments in PDA patients. Despite numerous studies that have previously examined different facets of PDA immunosuppression, there is still much that is unknown regarding the complex network of intercellular crosstalk that regulates this phenomenon. Our previous work has demonstrated that infiltrating macrophages are essential mediators of immunosuppression in PDA, and that their polarization is affected by the expression of oncogenic Kras in tumor cells. Other groups have characterized the immunosuppressive impact of certain fibroblast subgroups within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Preliminary experiments described in this proposal demonstrate a connection between fibroblasts, macrophages, and tumor cells through fibroblast expression of the cytokine interleukin-33 (IL33). The role of IL33 in cancer biology is controversial, with its overall effect on the tumor thought to be supportive or suppressive depending on the cancer context. Here, results show that IL33 abundance correlates with disease progression and that fibroblast expression of IL33 is dependent on oncogenic Kras-driven signals from tumor cells. Additionally, we have completed a pilot experiment whereby we have orthotopically implanted pancreatic tumor cells into a syngeneic genetically engineered mouse model lacking Il33 in fibroblasts (Il33f/f, Pdgfra-CreERT2/+). Tumors from Il33-deficient mice had slower tumor growth and a trending decrease in macrophage infiltration, suggesting that fibroblast-derived Il33 is both tumor promoting and may play a role in the recruitment of immunosuppressive macrophages. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to elucidate the cellular interactions that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of immunosuppression in PDA, and the central hypothesis is that fibroblast derived IL33 is a key regulator of immunosuppression in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment through its modulation of macrophage infiltration. This hypothesis will be investigated through the following two Aims: (Aim 1) define the regulation and role of IL33 in cancer-associated fibroblasts, and (Aim 2) assess the impact of IL33 on the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. To complete this investigation, a combination of in vitro assays using tumor cell, fibroblast, and macrophage cultures will be performed. We also will continue to utilize the Il33f/f, Pdgfra-CreERT2/+ genetically engineered mouse model to assess Il33-dependent changes in the immunosuppressive nature of pancreatic tumors. The data accumulated by this study will further the field’s understanding of immunosuppression regulation in PDA, and consequentially bring effective immunotherapy strategies one step closer to becoming a viable therapeutic option.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3181,440,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5R01DC018003-04,Noise-Induced Synaptic Loss and Vestibular Dysfunction,"Vestibular dysfunction is a significant public health problem. Agrawal et al. (2009) reported that 35% of adults older than 40 had evidence of postural instability. Balance dysfunction is linked to an increased likelihood of falling and in the U.S. falls are responsible for more than 50% of accidental deaths. Although the causes of vestibular dysfunction are multiple, recent studies suggest a linkage between noise-induced hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction (Akin et al. 2012; Golz et al. 2001; Guest et al. 2011; Zuniga et al 2012). The suggestion that noise exposure is also a risk factor for vestibular dysfunction is controversial as there is only limited experimental support for causal relationships between noise exposure and peripheral vestibular pathology and behavioral symptoms (e.g., poor balance). In our recently published study (Stewart et al. 2018), we exposed rats to 6 hours of 120dB SPL low frequency noise (3-octave band centered at 1500Hz) and found that neural activity in the vestibular nerve was reduced, as assessed by the vestibular short latency evoked potential (VsEP). Noise exposed animals also exhibited reduced numbers of immunostained afferents with calyx endings, especially calyx-only afferents that terminate on hair cells located in the striolar region of the sacculus (Stewart et al. 2018). More recent experiments show that noise, depending on its intensity, can cause either temporary or permanent threshold shifts of VsEP responses to jerk stimuli. Permanent noise induced VsEP threshold shifts could reflect loss of calyces and/or concomitant loss of ribbon synapses within calyces. This loss might be permanent or there could be recovery associated with reconnection of calyces or recovery of synapses. We hypothesize that noise disrupts peripheral vestibular synapses and/or synaptic transmission, transiently or permanently and causes functional vestibular loss. Determining the basis for synaptic/signal transmission failure in the vestibular periphery and the parameters that characterize damaging noise is a critical first step toward development of future preventative measures. Specific Aim 1 will determine the parameters of noise that causes temporary versus permanent changes to the VsEP and to peripheral vestibular nerve terminals and their synapses in the saccular and utricular maculae. Specific Aim 2 will extend the analysis of Aim 1 to examine the semicircular canal cristae and compare noise-induced changes in the cristae with those observed in the otolith organs. Specific Aim 3 will correlate changes in VsEP responses and noise induced synaptic pathology with behavioral assays: a beam crossing task, an otolith dependent behavior (macular ocular reflex, MOR), and a semicircular canal dependent behavior (vestibuloocular reflex, VOR).",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2808,414,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), which include depression and/or anxiety in the year before and/or after delivery, are common complications of pregnancy, affecting up to one in four women, with costs over $15 billion per year in the US. PMAD can negatively affect mothers, babies, and families beyond the perinatal period, and have lasting clinical and economic effects. PMAD treatment can improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes, yet mental health services are rarely used. No comprehensive data source documents the: 1) magnitude, 2) predictors, and 3) variation in disparities by race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography in healthcare utilization or obstetric delivery outcomes among women with PMAD. Almost no evidence documents the impact of community characteristics on these outcomes. There is no national plan for how best to address PMAD, overall, or within high-risk subgroups. Using data from publicly (Medicaid) and privately (Optum) insured women with PMAD, state survey data, input from a panel of perinatal mental health services and policy experts, and interviews with state maternal and infant health (MIH) and MH policy makers, we will: 1) identify patient-level clinical characteristics associated with MH and overall perinatal utilization and delivery-related outcomes among women with diagnosed PMAD, and establish accurate national and state-level estimates of disparities in care patterns and outcomes, including MH utilization, overall utilization, and delivery-outcomes; 2) determine contributions of community-level characteristics to perinatal utilization and delivery outcomes among women with PMAD using data from Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), Area Health Resource File (AHRF), and National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS); and 3) collaborate with an expert panel to develop an evidence-based policymaking guide for PMAD, which we will use to interview state maternal and infant health and mental health policy officials. Using Aim 1-2 findings and expert panel input, we will develop an EBP guide for PMAD. This guide will provide structure for interviews with state maternal and infant health and mental health policy officials from states with high and low relative performance on PMAD treatment and outcomes to help interpret quantitative findings, tailor recommendations, and assist in future PMAD policymaking initiatives. Given the dearth of research on disparities in addressing PMAD and associated utilization and delivery outcomes, and the high, inter-generational costs for mother and baby of ineffectively managed PMAD, this innovative, large-scale investigation will provide evidence for future policymaking and clinical interventions. Our findings and policy guidance could address disparities in outcomes for high cost, high risk subpopulations.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2996,426,2.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
3R01CA255743-02S1,MyGI Diet for Colorectal Cancer Prevention,"Project Summary This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA 21-070. The parent grant tests methods to assist high risk individuals in attaining both the weight management and diet quality goals for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Existing recruitment plans for this study mainly rely on clinic-based recruitment and research registries, strategies which have yielded largely well-educated, white study populations in our prior work. Here, we propose methods to optimize recruitment and retention using video education tools to de-mystify the research study, and personal technology assistants to address digital literacy barriers. In the first aim, three short videos will be made for the study website to introduce study staff, show how to reach the study site, explain the study objectives, show visit procedures and address privacy and security concerns. The goal is to build trust and de-mystify the clinical/medical aspects of the trial. Evaluations will include assessing the numbers of individuals contacted from the website versus other sources, comparisons with previous recruitment efforts of high-risk individuals (numbers over time, demographics), website feature usage, and interviews with study staff and enrolled participants to collect opinions regarding the utility of the website. In the second aim, we will evaluate the utility of a Personal Technology Assistant to spur both recruitment and retention of study participants. Limited technology proficiency is well documented to reduce participation in studies that require web-based tasks. This is especially true for older individuals and individuals with who are not yet adept at using the web. Personal Technology Assistants, who are trained to provide digital health literacy support in a culturally sensitive manner, will assist participants with the MyGI mobile app on request, at either the study site and/or at community sites. Evaluations will include quantitative data such as numbers of study participants requesting this assistance as well as interviews of both study participants and study staff. Mixed methods analysis of the quantitative and qualitative assessment data will yield robust information on the utility of the new strategies. If effective, use of both strategies will be continued throughout the study recruitment period. The ongoing maintenance costs will be undertaken by the parent study since the major costs involved with implementation of these aims is in the development of the strategies. The long-term goal of these efforts is to facilitate equitable recruitment and retention of participants in the parent study and to provide in-depth data on the utility of the methodologies that leads to their implementation in other trials.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2804,417,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R35GM149197-01,Signaling activation and constraints in maintaining immune homeostasis,"The innate immune system detects pathogen-derived molecules to prevent infections via specialized immune receptors. The immune receptors include cell surface-resident pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mammals and receptor kinases (RKs) in plants, and intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in plants and mammals. Plant PRRs detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), whereas NLRs recognize pathogen-specific effectors, culminating in a unified immune system. How the signaling networks underlying PRR- and NLR-mediated immunity are interconnected remains largely unknown. In addition, defects or over-activation of immune receptors could lead to cell death or autoimmunity. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that enable or constrain PRR and NLR activation for maintaining immune homeostasis is particularly important. The PI’s laboratory has developed a series of sensitive and high-throughput genetic screens to dissect the complex activation and signaling mechanisms in plant immunity, and revealed the importance of malectin-like RKs (MLRs) as a molecular module at the plasma membrane linking PRR and NLR immune receptors. PI’s long-term goal is to elucidate the signaling networks regulating innate immune responses using Arabidopsis as a model system and expand the knowledge of how hosts fend off infections without causing autoimmune disorders. The proposed research rooted in PI’s previous discoveries and preliminary studies will support a series of projects that address several critical knowledge gaps in two interrelated research areas. First, the research will elucidate how the PRR- and NLR-mediated signaling pathways converge into an interconnected and balanced immune response. Specifically, the projects will mechanistically address how a PRR-activated MAP kinase cascade regulates NLR-mediated immune homeostasis through MLRs perceiving different peptide ligands. Second, the research will decipher the immune gene orchestration through the combinatorial action of the layered transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational regulations at the single-cell level. The projects will focus on how intertwined posttranslational modifications, including ADP-ribosylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, regulate immune-specific gene transcription, stability, and translation. The proposed interdisciplinary research will provide ample training opportunities for diverse undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2530,326,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R34MH130207-02,Strengthening community responses to economic vulnerability and HIV inequities,"In the United States, transgender women of color (`trans women of color') experience cyclical, interlocking systems of structural and institutional oppression rooted in racism and transphobia, which fuel economic vulnerability. Together, cycles of intersecting racism, transphobia, and economic vulnerability create conditions that give rise to extreme HIV inequities among trans women of color. Microeconomic interventions – designed to improve financial standing by increasing income generation and access to financial resources through entrepreneurship, cash transfers, and training — have the potential to address structural factors underlying HIV risk. Over the past few years, several trans-led organizations, including the Trans Sistas of Color Project, have integrated microeconomic strategies, specifically emergency assistance (i.e., unconditional cash grants) into their programming. Building on our formative work in Detroit, this project seeks to adapt and examine the acceptability and feasibility of an enhanced microeconomic intervention designed to address HIV prevention and care continua outcomes. The enhanced microeconomic intervention builds on our community partner's existing microeconomic interventions, which includes: (1) an emergency assistance; and (2) peer and legal support to obtain legal gender affirmation (i.e., legal name and gender markers on identification documents). The existing intervention will be enhanced to include (1) weekly educational sessions on economic empowerment (i.e., job acquisition, income generation through micro-business, and financial literacy) and HIV prevention and care; (2) employment-focused mentoring; (3) weekly social media posts of job openings in Detroit; and (4) an unconditional grant ($1,200) for use towards acquiring self-led or formal employment. Our community advisory board composed of trans women of color will provide ongoing consultation. The proposed research plan is directly in line with the prioritization of sexual and gender minority communities for health disparities research and the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative, as well as NIH priority areas for reducing HIV incidence. Findings will provide the necessary groundwork to examine intervention efficacy and implementation processes in a future, large-scale trial.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2315,314,1.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01AT011341-03,Mechanisms of cannabidiol in persons with MS: the role of sleep and pain phenotype,"Chronic pain affects 35-40% of people with chronic neurological conditions, including persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) - an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system affecting approximately 1 million Americans. Unfortunately, the analgesic effects of conventional treatments for pain in neurological conditions is limited. Cannabidiol (CBD, derived from cannabis sativa) is a safe, promising complimentary therapy that is frequently used in combination with Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to treat pain in persons with MS (PwMS). However, the distinct analgesic mechanisms of CBD - relative to better-studied cannabinoid formulations such as THC or THC/CBD combinations (which carry abuse potential) - are not well understood, galvanizing the need for mechanistic research focused on CBD monotherapy. Preliminary data from a nationwide study of PwMS conducted by the investigators suggest that CBD could independently exert analgesic effects through improved sleep, particularly among PwMS with nociplastic (centralized) pain. Investigations that now build upon these early findings could provide novel insight into mechanisms by which CBD induces analgesic effects, and identify pain phenotypes that are most likely to be responsive to CBD for chronic pain. This innovative, mechanistic study proposes to apply novel polysomnographic sleep stage analyses that extend beyond conventional polysomnography (PSG) measures, and new features of sleep macrostructure derived from in-home actigraphy, to assess aspects of sleep that could play key mechanistic roles in the analgesic effects of CBD. Our overarching goal is to apply these novel sleep assessment methods, coupled with validated pain phenotyping techniques, to uncover unique mechanistic associations between CBD, sleep, and analgesia in PwMS, compared to THC monotherapy, THC/CBD combination therapy, or placebo. Persons with MS who experience chronic pain will undergo pain phenotyping with validated survey measures of nociplastic and neuropathic pain, and randomized to CBD (Epidiolex®), THC (dronabinol), THC/CBD combination, or placebo for 12 weeks. In-lab PSG and 14-day wrist-worn actigraphy will be collected at baseline and 12 weeks’ post-treatment. Changes in sleep microstructure (Aim 1; including sleep stage bout length, sleep stage transition probability, and entropy) and macrostructure (Aim 2; including sleep regularity, rhythmicity, timing and duration) will be compared between cannabinoid and placebo groups, and pain phenotype will be assessed as a predictor of CBD-related changes in sleep. Aim 3 will assess the measures of sleep microstructure and macrostructure as mediators of analgesic response to CBD. Data generated from this study will to inform CBD research, across a spectrum of neurological and other chronic conditions, that can be applied to the development of precision-medicine approaches for chronic pain.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2912,410,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F31DA056192-02,GPCR activation-based in vitro luminescent assays for high-throughput drug screening and extracted GPCR characterization,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) are transmembrane signaling proteins found abundantly throughout the body. GPCRs are responsible for regulating many physiological processes including pain modulation and drug addiction. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is one of the most significant GPCRs since it is implicated in the opioid epidemic as the primary target for therapeutic analgesics. High-throughput screening (HTS) methods for detecting GPCR activity are highly desirable for discovering alternative, nonaddictive agonists. All the existing screening platforms are based on maintaining live-cell cultures due to the lack of methods for characterizing GPCR activity in-solution. Here I propose the design of the first in-solution HTS bioluminescent assay for detecting GPCR activity which will greatly streamline the process of GPCR ligand screening. The new assay features conformation specific binders, including nanobodies (Nb) and peptidomimetics, which will bind to the activated conformation of the GPCR, both in-solution and in live-cell cultures. Components of a split bioluminescent enzyme, Nanoluciferase (split NanoLuc), will be attached to the GPCR and the conformation specific binder. When the agonist-dependent interaction occurs, the NanoLuc will reconstitute and produce a quantifiable bioluminescent signal in the presence of furimazine. I have already validated the feasibility of this in-solution bioluminescent assay using beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and its conformation-specific binders, a G-protein mimic Nanobody and a novel peptidomimetic. The assay will be applied for screening MOR agonists and antagonists using its conformation-specific nanobody binders, Nb39 and Nb44. Additionally, I propose to adapt the in-solution bioluminescent assay for broader applications using G-protein peptidomimetics. The platform will be used to screen agonists and antagonists for a wide variety of GPCRs, extending the screening capabilities to include additional GPCRs implicated in drug abuse. Lastly, this assay will provide a new approach to validate the structural integrity of GPCRs isolated from membranes using nanodiscs. Overall, the screening assay proposed here could have far-reaching therapeutic impacts resulting from the discovery of non-addictive pain medications or agonists to suppress opioid-induced addiction.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2364,321,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5T32HL125242-09,Training Program in Translational Cardiovascular Research and Entrepreneurship,"This renewal proposal seeks continued funding for the Training program in Translational Cardiovascular Research and Entrepreneurship (CVRE) at the University of Michigan. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. The mission of this program is to train the next generation of PhD scientists seeking careers in cardiovascular research in the ethical development and application of research results from the laboratory to the bedside, with the ultimate goal of improving therapy for patients. The proposed training program is intentionally designed to address the gap in training of young basic scientists and pre-doctoral students in key areas of translational cardiovascular research such as preclinical research design, drug discovery, device/therapy development, optimization and testing, research entrepreneurship, and regulatory compliance. The interdisciplinary and internationally recognized faculty of this program provides an outstanding training environment that includes state of the art facilities and techniques spanning genetic, molecular, cellular, systems, engineering and clinical investigation of both vascular and cardiac diseases. By capitalizing on the existing strengths of our faculty in basic, preclinical, and translational cardiovascular research, and unique academic resources at the University of Michigan, we will train students not only in state of the art biomedical research, but also in applying systems biology for preclinical testing, navigating regulatory compliance, and the process and challenges of research entrepreneurship. Therefore, this program offers students a unique comprehensive and immersive educational experience in translational research training. The added benefit is that the program will also prepare students for the diversity of scientific careers available to and often pursued by young scientists including academic research, start-up companies, biotechnology and large pharmaceutical and device companies.

5R01EB032328-02,Quantifying and Understanding Glaucoma Eye Drop Medication Instillation and Adherence,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Despite the availability of effective treatments, glaucoma remains the leading cause of irreversible blindness among African American adults and the second leading cause of irreversible blindness in the United States. Non-adherence to daily prescribed eye drop medications – the treatment for 89% of glaucoma patients - is a key modifiable driver of vision loss in glaucoma. In current practice, patients are diagnosed with glaucoma and simply given a prescription, with only 1 in 8 prescribing physicians teaching patients how to use eye drops. 40% of glaucoma patients do not take their daily eye drop medication according to the prescribed schedule. 20% of glaucoma patients do not succeed in getting drops into their eyes. Glaucoma primarily affects older adults who may have aging-related sensorimotor deficits that impair successful medication instillation. Our long term goal is to develop a comprehensive system to monitor medication use, quantify whether administered drops are successfully delivered, communicate usage data to the patient’s health care team, and coach each patient on how to use their eye drop medications. Our central hypothesis is that by identifying the biomechanical and sensorimotor factors associated with eye drop instillation success – whether a drop gets in the eye – we can develop more effective, personalized intervention strategies to improve medication adherence and increase instillation success. Our overall objectives are to: 1) use motion sensors that measure the biomechanical movement of instilling eye drops, together with tests of sensorimotor abilities, to identify factors that result in successful eye drop instillation success among older adults; and 2) use input from older participants to design a comprehensive, simple, and user-friendly Eye Drop Adherence Monitoring System (EAMS). The EAMS will consist of a low-power, portable, on-bottle sensor and a cellular-linked communication base station to identify remotely when an eye drop was dispensed and record the probability of successful instillation. The EAMS will also integrate a personalized text message program tailored to individual adherence levels. Following development, we will test the EAMS to assess the agreement between EAMS classification of an eye drop use event and eye drop instillation success and an eye drop use diary and video- recorded eye drop instillation. We will assess the acceptability of the system among a sample of glaucoma patients through qualitative interviews. Impact: Our interdisciplinary team will gain and share new knowledge about the biomechanics of eye drop instillation and the impact of the sensorimotor deficits of aging on eye drop medication use. This knowledge will inform the development of a scalable Eye Drop Adherence Monitoring System (EAMS) that can be used clinically to improve the effectiveness of glaucoma care in preventing vision loss. This tool will be able to assess adherence to eye drop medications in both the clinical and research settings. A deeper understanding will inform patient-centered approaches to self-management support and aid in closing outcomes disparities in glaucoma – and every other condition needing eye drop medications.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3233,483,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01AI165381-02,Roles of Macropinocytosis in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T Cells,"Title: Roles of Macropinocytosis in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T Cells Project Summary: Host cell entry is the first step in the replication cycle of HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS. Although receptor binding of viral Env glycoprotein and subsequent virus-cell fusion during the virus entry process have been described in detail, subcellular locations of these events remain to be determined. In particular, despite the importance of CD4+ T lymphocytes as a natural host cell type for HIV-1, the contribution of virion endocytosis to HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells remains poorly understood. Previous studies of HIV-1 entry into T cells have largely focused on clathrin-mediated endocytosis and cell surface fusion. However, our team recently discovered that primary CD4+ T cells engage in robust macropinocytosis, a large-scale, clathrin-independent form of endocytosis. Importantly, our preliminary data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of macropinocytosis blocks both internalization of HIV-1 particles and productive infection in primary human CD4+ T cells. In contrast, the same treatment does not affect HIV infection of a commonly used CD4+ T cell line. These results suggest that the macropinocytic entry is a hitherto overlooked mode of HIV-1 entry that contributes to infection of primary human CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, our preliminary study also showed that inhibition of macropinocytosis after completion of virus internalization also blocks expression of virus-encoded genes, suggesting that macropinocytosis has another later role in productive HIV infection, which is separable from virus internalization. In the current application, we propose to determine the roles of macropinocytosis in productive infection of primary CD4+ T cells. Our long-term goal is to fully describe cellular mechanisms that promote HIV-1 infection and to use the obtained knowledge for developing antiviral strategies. Our central hypothesis in this application is that macropinocytosis in primary human CD4+ T cells contributes to productive infection as a major HIV-1 entry pathway and as a cellular function necessary for maintaining a permissive environment for the virus. To test this hypothesis, we plan to determine: 1) the extent to which macropinocytic internalization contributes to productive HIV entry into primary human CD4+ T cells; 2) the roles played by Env-receptor interactions in promoting HIV-1 macropinocytosis; 3) the influence of macropinosome environment on HIV-1 entry; and 4) the nature of post-internalization macropinocytosis function that promotes productive infection. The outcomes of the experiments outlined in this proposal will likely fill the knowledge gap in our understanding of HIV-1 entry, a fundamental aspect of the HIV-1 replication cycle, and help us develop or improve antiviral strategies that target virus entry and establishment of productive infection in CD4+ T cells.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,2922,427,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F32GM140694-03,Sulfide metabolism at the host microbiome interface,"Project Summary Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a redox-active signaling molecule that modulates electron transport and energy metabolism, and by largely unknown mechanisms, mediates neuro- and cardioprotection, vasodilation, the hypoxic response, protein translation, epigenetics, aging, and both patho- and physiological responses in colon. As H2S is also a respiratory poison at high doses, cells actively oxidize it to produce persulfides, sulfite, thiosulfate, (collectively referred to as reactive sulfur species), and sulfate. Oxidative modification of protein cysteine thiols to persulfides is postulated to be a primary mechanism by which H2S signals. The potential involvement of other reactive sulfur species in signaling is however, unknown. Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that H2S impacts cellular redox metabolism via its dual effects on mitochondrial energetics, i.e. increasing electron flux at low, and inhibiting it at high concentrations. The highest exposure to exogenous H2S occurs in colon (0.2–2.4 mM) and is derived from gut resident microbiota, which synthesize sulfide. Preliminary data in our laboratory reveal that colonic epithelial cells quantitatively oxidize exogenous H2S to thiosulfate, and that the localization and expression levels of sulfide oxidation enzymes in murine colonocytes are strongly influenced by the presence or absence of sulfate reducing bacteria in the gut. I hypothesize that the dynamic interplay between host and microbial sulfur metabolites influences host metabolism and impacts longevity. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, which has the full complement of orthologous genes involved in H2S biogenesis and oxidation found in humans and is readily amenable to genetic and dietary manipulation and to life-span analyses, I will test my hypothesis by addressing the following two aims. (i) I will characterize how alterations in H2S levels and reactive sulfur species impact organismal redox and histone modifications that are linked to longevity and stress response in C. elegans. H2S levels and its oxidative byproducts will be modulated by exogenous H2S, RNA interference knockdowns of host sulfide oxidation enzymes, and by diet, using Escherichia coli with deletions in specific genes involved in sulfur metabolism. I will assess how exogenous versus dietary H2S modulation affects organismal redox using the genetically encoded reduction-oxidation sensitive GRX1-roGFP2 sensor and track changes in histone methylation and acetylation status with reported links to redox, H2S availability, diet, and aging. (ii) I will investigate how differences in exogenous H2S exposure from air versus gut microbes affects the expression and localization of host sulfide oxidation enzymes, the abundance and type of reactive sulfur species, and their effect on lifespan. I will complement these studies with metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses to identify pathways that are impacted by H2S exposure. The successful completion of these studies will be foundational to our understanding of the interplay of sulfur metabolism at the host-microbe interface.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3128,448,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01NS122751-03,Nonneuronal Mechanisms of Polyglutamine Neurodegeneration,"Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is one of at least nine diseases caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode abnormally long polyglutamine tracts in the disease proteins. Despite advances in disease understanding, much remains unknown about how the CAG expansion in the SCA3 disease gene, ATXN3, causes brain dysfunction and cell death. We recently discovered selective oligodendrocyte vulnerability across SCA3 mouse disease brain regions and identified early and robust changes that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. Our long-term objective is to understand pathogenic mechanisms in SCA3 and related polyglutamine diseases so that therapies targeting the most promising molecular and cellular targets can be developed for these fatal and currently untreatable disorders. Toward that objective, the team of investigators will leverage their diverse research expertise and a wide range of model systems including primary cell cultures, mouse models, and human disease tissue. Building on recent discoveries in mouse models and human disease tissue, we will investigate nonneuronal contributions to disease pathogenesis, with an emphasis on cells of the oligodendroglial lineage. In Aim 1, we will determine how widespread oligodendrocyte dysfunction is in SCA3 disease. In Aim 2, we will generate novel conditional SCA3 mouse models to establish if the mutant protein elicits cell-autonomous oligodendrocyte dysfunction and define oligodendrocyte dysfunction contributions to disease pathogenesis.

5R37CA262209-02,Defining epigenetic signaling to reshape pancreatic tumor microenvironment,"The 5-year survival of pancreatic cancer patients remains at 10% primarily due to the tumor resistance to standard chemo and immunotherapies. The profound immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment contributes to treatment resistance. Notably, 82% of the neoadjuvant-treated pancreatic cancers carry loss of function mutations for KMT2D, a histone modification enzyme. Epigenetics is known to impact cancer cell behavior. However, how tumor cell-intrinsic epigenetic alterations modulate the pancreatic tumor microenvironment remains elusive. The long-term goal is to develop new treatments to convert pancreatic cancer to an immunologically hot tumor and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy and patient survival. The overall objectives in this application are to 1) determine the impact of KMT2D signaling on the tumor microenvironment and 2) characterize the mechanisms by which KMT2D regulates activin A expression. The central hypothesis is that upregulation of activin A upon KMT2D loss in pancreatic cancer reprograms cancer- associated fibroblasts and immune cells to promote a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive microenvironment. The rationale for this project is that the knowledge of the mechanisms by which KMT2D regulates the tumor microenvironment will pave the way for future preclinical and clinical development of new strategies to treat pancreatic cancer. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Elucidate the impact of KMT2D signaling on the immune composition in the tumor microenvironment; 2) Define the regulation of heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts by KMT2D signaling; and 3) Determine the molecular mechanisms of activin A regulation by KMT2D in pancreatic cancer. Under the first and second aims, we will use our established pancreatic cancer genetic mouse models with pancreas-specific inactivation of KMT2D to determine the impact of KMT2D signaling on the differentiation and activation of cancer- associated fibroblasts, macrophages, and T cells, and ligand-receptor interactions in the tumor microenvironment and the underlying mechanisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing technology, mass cytometry, and multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry will be used. For the third aim, we will characterize the interactions between KMT2D and co-factors and the mechanisms of KMT2D-mediated regulation of activin A transcription and enhancer activity using ChIP-seq, BruUV-seq, and functional luciferase reporter assays. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on a novel concept that epigenetic signaling from tumor cells remodels the tumor microenvironment and contributes to cancer progression and uses state-of-the-art animal models and approaches. The proposed research is significant because it will shed light on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by KMT2D in pancreatic cancer and the effect of KMT2D signaling on pancreatic tumor microenvironment, which will set the stage for future preclinical and clinical development of new tumor microenvironment-targeting treatment strategies.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3092,426,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HD084163-09,"The Development of Eating Behavior in Infancy: Associations with Behavior, Diet, and Growth to Age 6 years","PROJECT SUMMARY Eating behaviors are robustly associated with dietary quality and weight gain. Given the relevance of eating behaviors to health in children and adults, remarkably little is known regarding the development of these behaviors from infancy, and their continuity (or discontinuity) into childhood. Eating behaviors can be phenotyped in infancy through rigorous measurement of behavior following exposure to different stimuli under careful experimental control, though no studies prior to R01HD084163 have phenotyped multiple eating behaviors objectively in a single longitudinal infant cohort. Eating behavior may be modifiable between infancy and early childhood, potentially altering any associations with future dietary quality or weight gain. Interventions that promote adaptive maternal feeding practices have been effective in reducing obesity risk. Intervention effects might be further strengthened by tailoring to characteristics of the individual child. Identifying interactions of carefully phenotyped child eating behavior and maternal feeding practices in an observational cohort study is an important initial step towards future tailored intervention development. The proposed work will examine for the first time the continuity (or discontinuity) of extensively phenotyped eating behaviors in infancy, based on novel objective measures and maternal report, to age 5 years. The work will, for the first time, test whether maternal feeding practices and infant eating behaviors interact to predict child eating behaviors at age 5 years, as well as dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years. The ABC Baby study (R01HD084163, 7/1/15-06/30/20) and its ancillary funded studies used novel behavioral protocols to phenotype eating behavior and maternal feeding practices longitudinally at ages 2 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months in a cohort of 286 infants. The current application proposes to follow up with 200 of these children at ages 5 and 6 years to address the following aims: Aim 1: To test the cross-lagged associations between child eating behaviors and maternal feeding practices across infancy and age 5 years. We hypothesize that child eating behaviors in infancy predict child eating behaviors at age 5 years, maternal feeding practices in infancy predict maternal feeding practices at age 5 years, child eating behaviors in infancy predict maternal feeding practices at 5 years, and maternal feeding practices in infancy predict child eating behaviors at 5 years. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that eating behaviors measured in infancy have direct and indirect (through eating behaviors at age 5 years) associations with dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years. Aim 3: To test the hypotheses that maternal feeding practices in infancy moderate associations of infant eating behaviors with eating behaviors at 5 years, and that maternal feeding practices at 5 years moderate associations of eating behaviors in infancy with dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years, and moderate associations of eating behaviors at age 5 years with dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3103,468,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5T35DK131960-03,Short-Term Research Training Program in NIDDK Mission Areas,"Substantive research training early during the course of medical school education is critical to address the declining number of physicians choosing research careers. The proposed University of Illinois Short-Term Research Training Program (SRTP) will provide first year medical students (12 slots in Year 1, 15 in Year 2-5) with a 10-week mentored research experience in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) mission areas including, kidney, urologic and hematologic diseases; digestive disease and nutrition; and diabetes, endocrinology and metabolic disease. The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UI COM) is a large public medical school with one of the most diverse student populations in the country in terms of enrolled African American and Latino students. The program will draw from first year medical students at UI COM, as well as other medical schools in the Chicago metropolitan area and Midwest. We have assembled an outstanding team of mentors in NIDDK mission areas with expertise in basic/mechanistic, clinical/translational, and behavioral/community-based research. In addition to mentored research, students will participate in an interactive structured curriculum focused on research methodology, responsible conduct of research, and career development. To learn presentation skills and principles of rigor and reproducibility, students will co- lead, with a research mentor, journal clubs and works-in-progress sessions. Additional novel aspects of the program include use of peer-to-peer mentoring and ongoing exposure to successful early career physician- scientists. At the end of the summer, students will present at a SRTP Research Symposium and the COM Research Day. After the program is completed, the program will utilize multiple strategies to facilitate continued involvement in research activities, including encouraging students to apply to the James Scholar Program, a program that provides the infrastructure to support research during the second to fourth years of medical school. In addition, the program will strive to create a sense of community among SRTP cohorts by hosting quarterly “Ideas on Tap” (research/social networking events at which students present ongoing research), and will maintain connections with trainees using the program website, newsletters, an SRTP Slack communication channel, and social media. An Executive Committee will oversee implementation of the program, recruitment/selection, program evaluation, and tracking of short- and long-term outcomes. Strengths of the program include the experienced co-Directors, committed and well-funded program mentors with broad expertise across NIDDK mission areas, an innovative structured curriculum, a robust recruitment plan to enhance diversity, strong institutional support, and a thoughtfully conceived plan to foster continued research involvement after program completion. Consequently, the proposed SRTP will provide medical students with a substantive research experience, facilitating the achievement of the long-term objective of increasing the pipeline and diversity of physicians entering the research workforce in NIDDK mission areas.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3202,447,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R33HL155160-04,"The ALOHA trial: Addressing Quality of Life, Clinical Outcomes, and Mechanisms in Uncontrolled Asthma Following the DASH Dietary Pattern","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Asthma prevalence has increased markedly in the United States, with 19 million adults reporting current asthma and 62% of them with uncontrolled asthma. Poor diet quality is an important risk factor implicated in this alarming trend as a typical western diet features processed, energy-dense, nutrient-deficient foods, promoting a proinflammatory host environment. Diet quality in asthma is an emerging area of research; few interventional trials have investigated healthy dietary patterns in adults with asthma, none was adequately powered to determine efficacy, and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To fill this gap, the current 2-phase, milestone-driven ALOHA trial will rigorously evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of a behavioral intervention promoting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). This behavioral intervention showed promising results in a pilot trial among adults with uncontrolled asthma. METHODS: The R61 phase (1 year) will focus on finalizing trial planning and preparation and begin early enrollment; in the R33 phase (4 years) we will conduct a 2-arm randomized clinical trial over 12 months. Adults with uncontrolled asthma (n=320) on standard controller therapy will be equally randomized and assessed at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months. The control and intervention groups will be matched on the number, frequency, and format of sessions over 12 months while the length of each session is proportional to the content delivered. Control participants will receive education on lung health, asthma, and other general health topics using American Lung Association and UpToDate materials. The intervention group will receive the same health education and materials in addition to DASH behavioral counseling. Central hypothesis: Compared with the education-only control, the DASH behavioral intervention will lead to significantly more participants with a clinically significant improvement (responders) in asthma-specific quality of life (primary outcome) and significantly greater improvements in related asthma and non-asthma outcomes, which will be mechanistically linked to improved diet quality. SPECIFIC AIMS: First, to determine intervention efficacy on the primary outcome of clinically significant improvement in asthma-specific quality of life at 12 months and secondary outcomes (asthma control, lung function, generic qualify of life, blood pressure, mental health, sleep health). Second, to examine the intervention effects on metabolomic (circulating short-chain fatty acids: propionate, butyrate, acetate), immune response (interferon-gamma, IL-5, IL-17A, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα), and physiologic (bronchodilator responsiveness) biomarkers of asthma. Third, to examine the intervention effects on self- reported and objective indices of diet quality (DASH score, dietary inflammatory index, serum carotenoids). We also will conduct exploratory analyses of causal mediation linking diet quality, biomarkers, and asthma outcomes as well as effect modification by sex and other biological variables (age of asthma onset, atopy). IMPACT: This trial has high potential to advance the clinical and mechanistic understandings of diet quality in asthma.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3302,462,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01MH134262-02,J-RISE: Relevant Implementation Strategies to Eliminate the social and structural barriers to HIV services among Justice-involved Black men who have sex with men,"Project Summary Justice-involved Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are particularly vulnerable to HIV, and oftentimes experience delayed uptake and benefit from available HIV services. Status neutral interventions for justice- involved BMSM are pertinent and urgently needed to address the social and structural barriers to HIV services (e.g., unemployment) experienced by this population. Our collaborative has prioritized four status neutral interventions (i.e., transitional case management [TCM], employment navigation [EN], contingency management intervention [CMI], and employer outreach and support [EOS). Combining these interventions together will maximize their independent effectiveness and provide significant promise for improving access to HIV and employment-related services for justice-involved BMSM. We will utilize seven prioritized bundled implementation strategies to support the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of status neutral interventions within community and criminal justice settings. The overarching goals of the planned multi-site type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study, J-RISE: Relevant Implementation Strategies to Eliminate the social and structural barriers to HIV services among Justice-involved BMSM is to simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of two packaged status neutral interventions within justice and community settings to improve access to HIV and employment-related services. J-RISE is led by an academic, community, and criminal justice collaborative and conducted in three Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) jurisdictions in Illinois and Louisiana. Aim 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of two packaged status neutral interventions (TCM versus TCM+EN+CMI) on primary outcomes (linkages to HIV care, PrEP care, and employment-related services within 90 days) and secondary outcomes (receipt of mental health and substance use services, retention in HIV care, viral suppression, PrEP persistence, and sustained employment) among justice-involved BMSM. Aim 2. Evaluate the bundled implementation strategies and implementation outcomes at multiple levels using CFIR, RE-AIM, and MIPA. Key implementation outcomes include acceptability, adoption, costs, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability. J-RISE will generate novel information about the utility of our chosen implementation strategies as well as critical information about the effectiveness and cost of packaged status neutral interventions to optimize HIV and employment-related outcomes for justice-involved BMSM in multiple EHE jurisdictions.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2587,335,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DE033167-02,Dual Delivery of Engineered EVs and Growth Factor for Bone Regeneration,"The inflammatory conditions and the complex physiological changes associated with chronic immunological responses to wound healing in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) challenge the outcomes of the treatments for bone regeneration. The related morbidity and costs associated with bone healing failures are considerable and increasing. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that the immune system is tightly linked to bone physiology and that MSC derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a prominent role in immunomodulation of bone repair. While recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2) mediated bone regeneration is well established, the challenges of controlling inflammation arising from rhBMP2 usage is exacerbated in the presence of immunomodulating systemic diseases such as T2DM present a significant knowledge gap that limit clinical outcomes. Based on preliminary studies of inflammation informed MSC EV microRNA (miRNA) composition and effects on immunomodulation and bone regeneration, we hypothesize that a dual delivery of engineered MSC EVs with anti-inflammatory properties and rhBMP2 using a combinatorial delivery system with self-assembling leucine zipper (LZ) peptide-based hydrogels and alginate beads can enhance bone healing in T2DM. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. In aim 1, we will test our preliminary data driven hypothesis that a subset of altered miRNAs in preconditioned MSC EVs contributes to the enhanced immunomodulatory function of the inflammatory preconditioned MSC derived EVs. We will also generate engineered MSC EVs that overexpress candidate miRNA with anti-inflammatory properties to further study the mechanistic aspects by which individual EV related miRNAs control the immunomodulation functionality. In aim 2, we will create a novel dual delivery system with LZ-hydrogels and alginate beads that contain engineered EVs and rhBMP2 respectively. We will test our hypothesis that 1) EVs with anti-inflammatory properties (generated from aim 1) can be released during the inflammatory phase of healing (up to 7 days) from a self-assembling LZ- hydrogel and 2) rhBMP2 that is encapsulated in alginate beads with an extended-release profile (4-6 weeks) can provide a long term osteoinductive signal to promote/enhance bone regeneration. In aim 3, using a diabetic mouse calvarial defect model, we will test the hypothesis that engineered MSC EVs containing anti-inflammatory miRNA will suppress inflammation upon wounding while sustained released rhBMP2 promote bone healing. Overall, the results of these first studies of the combinatorial usage of engineered and MSC EVs rhBMP2 will provide a foundation for continued definition of MSC EV-mediated immunomodulation, and the regenerative properties and applicability of the dual delivery system to bone healing in T2DM. Further, these studies will also provide a framework for the use of growth factors and engineered EVs in combination for tissue engineering applications.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2991,429,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5UL1TR002389-08,The Institute for Translational Medicine,"Contact PD/PI: Solway, Julian Chapter O: Overall ABSTRACT ITM 3.0: ADVANCING HEALTH TOWARD HEALTH EQUITY THROUGHOUT METROPOLITAN CHICAGO The University of Chicago – Rush University Institute for Translational Medicine (ITM) was created in 2007 to assemble, integrate, and create the intellectual, administrative, and physical resources required to catalyze research and research training in Clinical and Translational Science. We have trained university scientists and health care providers as well as stakeholders from concerned communities to work together to determine the biological, behavioral, and social determinants of disease; to develop and test interventions directed toward those mechanisms; and to achieve these goals in a way that is rigorous, efficient, ethical, respectful of, and responsive to our communities’ priorities and values. The ITM has capitalized on outstanding intellectual and physical resources throughout UChicago, Rush, and ITM affiliate institutions – Loyola University Chicago, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Advocate Aurora Health Care, and Illinois Institute of Technology – and on substantial multi-institutional investments to build the sustainable infrastructure for a transformative, energetic, and self-improving home for clinical and translational research. Now, we pursue a bold guiding vision for “ITM 3.0” – that reversing the adverse health consequences of structural racism requires accounting for and mitigating the social, environmental, behavioral, and psychological factors (the entire lived experience, which we will call the “sociome”) through which structural racism impairs health. Focus on the sociome is critical because: 1) sociome factors interact with human biology to exacerbate or cause disease and injury, and 2) illness of any origin can compound the negative effects of adverse sociome factors. Since both sociome and biological systems, and their interactions, determine health, our CTSA hub must provide investigators, trainees, and stakeholders with the resources and knowledge to account for and address health disruptors throughout both systems. Our strategy to implement this vision is to create new training mechanisms, research platforms, communications channels, and safeguards against harm to ensure that all ITM investigators and institutions approach health problems with a wider-angle sociome lens in an ethical way. Then, our scientific, institutional, and community stakeholders can together design, test, and disseminate biological and/or sociome-directed interventions at the levels of individual, community, and society to improve mutually defined health concerns. ITM 3.0 will work hand-in-hand with partners throughout Chicagoland and the nation, combining academic rigor with community wisdom to conceptualize, develop and deploy innovative, just, and ethical interventions/practices to achieve our common goal, and so lessen the health impact of structural racism.

5R01DA058965-02,Achieving Equity in Patient Outcome Reporting for Timely Assessments of Life with HIV and Substance Use (ePORTAL HIV-S),"PROJECT SUMMARY Substance use disorder (SUD) and HIV are synergistic epidemics (syndemics) disproportionately affecting Black Americans. Structural racism related to inadequate access to healthcare, stigma, and criminalization, especially among those with intersectional identities related to gender and sexual minorities, further exacerbate disparities in HIV and SUD outcomes. SUD is often unrecognized and untreated among PLWH. Only about half of HIV care sites routinely screen and refer to SUD treatment. In preliminary work, we found that nearly half of patients assessed in an HIV clinic waiting room met criteria for a SUD, but 65% had not been diagnosed with SUD. A promising strategy to address structural barriers to SUD screening for PLWH is use of electronic patient portals. Portals are secure websites that give patients access to health information and allow for secure messaging with providers. They are associated with improved health outcomes and patient engagement. Importantly, while most SUD screening currently occurs during clinic visits, portals can be utilized for SUD screening to reach patients who miss clinic visits, which is more common among people with HIV and SUD. Our preliminary work has demonstrated the potential of the portal for use in a population health approach to behavioral health screening, but minoritized populations are less likely to enroll in portals. Approaches are need to enhance engagement of Black PLWH for utilization of the portal for SUD screening. Beyond SUD screening, Black PLWH face structural barriers to SUD treatment, including the lack of treatment centers in communities with higher proportions of Black residents. However, a new model of treatment (Collaborative Care Model (CoCM)) integrates a social work care manager and consulting psychiatrist into the primary setting and has been shown improve SUD outcomes. CoCM for SUD could address treatment barriers related to stigma and structural racism for Black PLWH and SUD. This proposal will implement and evaluate multi-level interventions to decrease barriers to SUD screening (clinic-based, in-person) and treatment (referral-focused), a program we call ePORTAL HIV-S. ePORTAL HIV- S will be implemented at the Chicago Department of Public Health-funded South Side Health Home (S2H2), the main provider of HIV prevention and care services for Chicago’s South Side, a majority Black community disproportionately impacted by HIV and SUD. Alongside our Community Advisory Board, we propose to carry out 4 aims: 1) Design and implement a strategy to increase patient portal engagement among Black PLWH; 2) Perform a randomized controlled trial to assess effectiveness of population health vs. usual (clinic-visit) SUD screening among PLWH in an HIV clinic; 3) Implement and evaluate CoCM for SUD in an HIV clinic; and 4) Develop an implementation guide for external dissemination of ePORTAL HIV-S. Our ultimate goal is to achieve health equity in SUD screening and treatment among Black PLWH.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3011,454,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R01EY035221-01A1,Pathophysiology of Chronic and Delayed Mustard Gas Keratopathy,"This is an application to the Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) NIH-wide program part of the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program. Sulfur mustard (SM), a chemical warfare agent, and nitrogen mustard (NM), a chemotherapeutic agent, are both potent vesicants. The cornea is exquisitely sensitive to these agents leading to keratitis, vascularization, ulceration, and perforations. Following acute SM exposure, a subset of patients will experience chronic/delayed-onset ocular complications known as mustard gas keratopathy (MGK). Delayed MGK reportedly can manifest several years after the initial exposure and presents with severe corneal disease with significant visual loss. We have made the observation that in experimental animal models of NM injury to the cornea, there is dose-dependent increased senescence in the cornea. We hypothesize that senescence in the cornea promotes tissue dysfunction and inflammationand that senescence after mustard injury contributes to the progression of chronic MGK and the severity of delayed MGK. We further hypothesize that reducing/eliminating senescent cells may alter the progression and severity of MGK. In this application we propose in Aim1 to investigate the role of senescence and SASP in the progression of corneal disease following acute exposure to NM; and in Aim 2 to investigate the role of senescence in a new model of delayed MGK. At the conclusion of these studies, we expect to have an improved understanding of the role of senescence in the development of MGK and identify novel approaches for its prevention/treatment.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,1603,235,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1F30MH138058-01,Sleep as a Mechanism of Premenstrual Exacerbation of Depression and Suicidality,"Aligned with the NIMH 2023 Strategic Plan, which highlights suicide prevention and digital health as research priorities, the proposed project is consistent with NIH’s strategic goal to examine mental illness trajectories across the lifespan. The proposed project utilizes high-resolution digital health sleep data in a clinical trial to identify periods of acute suicide risk and potential sleep-related treatment targets, while also examining the impact of the menstrual cycle in these processes. Suicide is a leading cause of death, and it is important for ongoing studies to focus on when patients may be at imminent risk. Emerging research suggests the menstrual cycle and sleep disturbances are time-varying modulators of acute depression and suicidality. The primary mentor’s prior work substantiates a link between cyclical changes in ovarian steroids and suicidality and confirms that most patients recruited for recent suicidal ideation (SI) demonstrate perimenstrual worsening of SI. Further, the laboratory’s two crossover RCTs demonstrate that natural perimenstrual steroid withdrawal serves as a recurring trigger for worsened suicidality and depression that can be reversed with E2+P4 supplementation. However, treatment of this kind is not feasible long-term due to clotting and hormone-dependent cancer risks, so it is critical to identify physiological mediators of these effects which may be treatment targets. Sleep disturbances also predict acute increases in suicidality/depression and there is within-person worsening in sleep perimenstrually suggesting that sleep may be a time-varying physiological mediator for the relationship between the cyclical hormones and suicidality in some people. The proposed study will utilize archival data from the primary mentor’s recently completed R01-funded RCT, which the candidate was instrumental in collecting, in 150 AFAB transdiagnostic patients with suicidality, including 1-3 months of daily surveys, hormonally confirmed cycle phases, and wearable sleep data (Oura ring), to evaluate the role of sleep in perimenstrual exacerbation of SI/depression. The proposed study has several novel aspects: 1) High temporal resolution sleep data across long observation periods; 2) Analytic methods that consider individual differences in cyclical hormone sensitivity and sleep patterns; 3) Experimental ovarian hormone manipulation to establish causality in the relationship between sleep disturbances, cycling hormones, and suicidality/depression. The proposed project will provide clinical trial research experience, training in nomothetic and idiographic statistical modeling, and collaborative mentorship in methods and clinical exposure in sleep and reproductive psychiatry to help the candidate achieve long-term career goals in academic medicine.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2812,387,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1U01NS136401-01,BRAIN CONNECTS: Photoemission Electron Microscopy for Connectomics,"We propose to develop a new microscope for connectomes with the potential to reduce the price of a connectomic voxel by order(s) of magnitude. We will focus on a relatively unexplored type of EM microcopy based on excitation of photoelectrons by UV light and their detection with standard widefield EM optics (PEEM). Simply, PEEMs for connectomes can combine the reliability of SEM imaging with the thruput of TEM imaging. We have demonstrated for the first time that PEEMs can see synapse and we have designed a tailored PEEM microscope with strong UV excitation from lasers and direct EM detectors that can work at Gigahertz imaging rates. We will explore collecting 1000s of ultra-thin brain slices (UTBS) using two state of the art automated approaches, the ATUM and Mag-C. We will optimize this pipeline, extending our current sample preparation to support such imaging rates, adding Gas Cluster Ion milling to improve the Z-resolution of PEEM connectomes, and, by designing, developing, and integrating a new generation of fast stages that keep up with imaging rates. Finally, we will instantiate auto- acquisition and quality assurance algorithms, e.g., auto-focus, auto-sigmate, etc. to facilitate the imaging and collection of 1000s of ultrathin brain sections.

5R35GM138150-05,Epigenesis of Cell Fate Potential,"The coordination of cellular function to developmental and environmental cues is essential for organismal growth and adaptation. Cells have a remarkable ability to sense diverse stimuli and make regulatory decisions to elicit an appropriate response. Our laboratory is interested in the molecular underpinnings of this cellular decision-making. Seminal “receptor-switch” experiments demonstrated that the cell’s sensing apparatus does not alone promote a specific cell fate. Rather, the cell’s sensing mechanism triggers a pre-existing nuclear program that was poised during development. How is this pre-existing program established? At what stage in development does it occur? What are the determinants that establish and maintain this potential for lineage- specific effector responses? The long-term goal of the laboratory is to define the biological processes that provide answers to these fundamental questions. Our model system is T cells, an ideal framework because the stages of development are highly characterized and the cells are widely available. Our approach focuses on the regulation of chromatin, i.e. the 6 billion bases of human DNA wrapped around nucleosomes that can take on different conformations to define gene activity and cellular identity. One of the modes by which chromatin is regulated is through the actions of chromatin remodeling complexes that use energy from ATP to modify which regions of the genome are accessible to transcription factors and signaling pathways. We have recently identified a novel chromatin remodeling complex that promotes the accessibility of genes encoding specialized T cell function. This ATPase motor acts early in development to poise cells even prior to the expression of the T cell receptor. In the next 5 years, we aim to identify the subunit composition of this novel chromatin remodeling complex and the direct mechanistic modes that mediate complex targeting and function at T cell effector loci. Achievement of our research goals will also provide a foundation for advances in clinical applications of T cell biology, e.g modulation of T cell effector programming to enhance the efficacy of vaccination, cancer immunotherapy, or tolerance induction for autoimmunity.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2234,332,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R35GM146936-03,Pyroptosis is a Trial-by-Fire Program,"TITLE Pyroptosis is a Programmed Trial-by-Fire. PROJECT ABSTRACT The inflammatory cell death program pyroptosis occurs in a wide range of cell types and plays important roles in development, tissue injury, and tumor growth. Curiously, unlike other cell death mechanisms, cells frequently survive pyroptosis activation. The persistence of a family of “inefficient” cell death genes is puzzling and suggests they may have other roles. Intuitively, cells that survive the inflammatory insult will dictate both the short-term adaptation and long-term repair and regeneration afterwards. Therefore, a flawed death program may actually be a “trial”. However, the details of cell survival after pyroptosis and the biochemical circuitry beyond its activation are under-studied, hindering our basic understanding. In this Program, we hypothesize that cell death is a side- effect of pyroptosis, which in fact aims to reprogram cell functions. To explore the new concept that “trial-by-fire” provides strong evolutionary advantages, we will investigate 1) whether it is possible to stop/resume pyroptosis and the basic mechanisms used to exert such control; 2) the capacity and limits of pyroptosis signaling; and 3) the single cell phenotypic effects of weathering pyroptosis. In pursuing this central hypothesis, we will discover new cell signaling circuits and simultaneously enhance the field’s ability to detect novel pathways by developing new genetically encoded tools, imaging algorithms, and bioinformatics methods. The Program aims to construct a new perspective that the salient function of pyroptosis is to prime and educate through a near-death experience.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,1659,240,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1F30HD116496-01,Investigation of Social and Behavioral Drivers of HIV Risk Among South African Adolescent Girls and Young Women,"South Africa has the greatest burden of HIV infection in the world, and South African adolescent girls and young women (SA-AGYW) ages 15-24 are at greatest risk. Mental health distress (anxiety, trauma, depression) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are implicated as drivers of HIV, yet few studies have assessed the combined effects of mental health and IPV on SA-AGYW sexual risk behavior (early sexual debut, no condom use at last sex, multiple sexual partners). Notably, high warmth and frequent communication about sexual topics between female caregivers and AGYW are associated with reduced AGYW sexual risk behavior, but few studies have examined the impact of female caregiver-AGYW communication and warmth in the presence of mental health distress and IPV on AGYW sexual risk taking. The proposed fellowship will provide much needed training to prepare me for a career as a physician scientist with a global health program of research. Guided by an expert mentorship team to oversee my training activities, I will gain skills in adolescent and young adult mental health distress, sexual risk behaviors, and their roles as drivers of HIV infection, HIV epidemiology, advanced qualitative research, and complete my medical and PhD degrees. I will use these new skills to carry out a mixed methods research study integrating quantitative and qualitative methods to accomplish two specific aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct secondary analyses of baseline data from a large HIV prevention intervention involving SA-AGYW and their female caregivers (IMARA-SA). Analyses of 642 AGYW will examine mental health distress, IPV, and AGYW-caregiver warmth and communication as drivers of AGYW sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Preliminary data from the parent study revealed high rates mental health distress and IPV. I hypothesize that increased warmth and communication between AGYW and female caregivers will decrease the association between mental health distress and sexual risk behaviors even in the presence of IPV. In Aim 2, I will supplement the quantitative analysis with 20- 30 qualitative interviews with SA-AGYW with experiences of IPV. I will purposively select participants from the parent study who have completed the 12-month follow up and reported IPV. Interviews will offer new insight into the impact of female caregiver communication about addressing experiences of IPV and sexual risk behavior. The findings from aims 1 and 2 will inform interventions to improve the SA-AGYW mental health, lessen IPV exposure, and strengthen sexual and reproductive health. Mentorship provided by an experienced team with a long history of collaboration will ensure excellent training, extensive opportunities to publish in high impact journals and present at international scientific conferences, and exposure to colleagues through networking.

Summary of parent-award Specific Aims. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012 to increase the understanding of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Related to this goal was the improvement of patient-centered assessment of LUTS. This work involves improving the self-report measurement of LUTS using new, high-quality items to be used in questionnaire assessments. These items were created with qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. This set of items is referred to as the Comprehensive Assessment of Self-Reported Urinary Symptoms (CASUS). The original aims of the grant were Aim 1: To refine and expand a clinically-relevant cluster model across a cohort of patients with LUTS. Relative to LURN I, participants will have a wider range of symptom severity and be characterized using novel measures of bladder and urethral function; Aim 2: To identify protein biomarker signatures contained within plasma of specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; Aim 3: To determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; Aim 4 To validate comprehensive outcome tools for men and women with LUTS; and Aim 5: To determine influences of stress and mental health on LUTS. In this supplement, we will focus on the following additional activities: Aim 5.1. Determine the relationship between level of cognitive function and LUTS. LUTS increase with age and are associated with greater impairment in performing activities of daily living, lower mood, and poorer overall health quality. More recently, LUTS have been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The LURN II data present a unique opportunity to further elucidate the relationship between cognition and LUTS. Within Aim 5.1, our hypothesis is: Cognitive function, measured by BrainTest, which is based on the electronic version of the self-administered gerocognitive examination (eSAGE), will be related to LUTS; Aim 5.2. Determine baseline predictors of LUTS trajectories in a sample of men and women with urinary urgency. We will conduct separate analyses in men and women who have urinary urgency and other LUTS. We propose to create models of the trajectory of LUTS for each participant, and then relating these trajectories to patient health variables. We will explore baselines symptoms, combined with other health variables that have been explored in LURN I such as BMI, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. We also plan to explore psychosocial variables that have not been explored with respect to urgency: intolerance of uncertainty, catastrophizing, and adverse childhood experiences.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2959,439,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL161386-03,Role of Adiposomes in Diabetes-Associated Endothelial Dysfunction and Restorative Effects of Exercise and Metabolic Surgery,"The development of type II diabetes (T2D) is strongly associated with obesity, and both are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Vascular dysfunction is an early event in developing cardiovascular disease in obese diabetic (OB-T2D) patients. Therefore, we set our long-term goal to define molecular mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and corrective strategies that target these mechanisms, such as physical activity and weight loss. We recently discovered that human adipose tissues release extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) that are efficiently captured by endothelial cells. Adiposomes are known to carry bioactive cargos such as proteins and micro RNAs; however, their lipid content has not been studied, neither their ability to transfer their lipid cargo to endothelial cells. In the current application, we propose investigating the role of adiposomes in communicating the unhealthy milieu, mainly dysregulated lipids, to endothelial cells in OB-T2D subjects. On top of these lipid species that we propose to be carried by adiposomes are glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs originate from ceramide glycosylation, a chemical process that is upregulated in the presence of inflammation and high glucose levels. Our preliminary findings showed that in endothelial cells, GSL-rich adiposomes disturb plasma membrane structure and subsequently induces endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, we found preconditioning endothelial cells with high shear stress (which is an exercise mimetic) protected endothelial cells from the detrimental effects caused by adiposomes. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that adipose tissues in OB-T2D patients release GSL-loaded adiposomes that induce vascular endothelial dysfunction. We propose that exercise and weight loss interventions (bariatric surgery) will restore adipose tissue homeostasis, reduce GSL-loaded adiposomes, and subsequently alleviate vascular risk in OB-T2D patients. We will test our hypotheses by pursuing the following Aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of GSL-rich adiposomes in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in OB- T2D adults; Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of exercise training in reducing adiposome-mediated effects on vascular function; and Aim 3: Examine changes in adiposome/caveolae axis following metabolic surgery and their association with vascular function. This study will improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological underpinning of adiposome production, packaging, and role in inducing ED under conditions of obesity and T2D. It will also identify adiposomes and the proposed mechanisms of their interaction with endothelial cells as novel therapeutic targets for improving vascular function in OB-T2D individuals. Once these pathways are elucidated, strategies for targeting them can be advanced, leading to an improved therapeutic management of T2D-related cardiovascular disease.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2898,398,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL152515-04,Amplification Mechanisms of Lung Endothelial Inflammation During Acute Lung Injury,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Lung failure from endotoxemia and sepsis induces widespread and often rapid lung vascular endothelial injury due to unfettered influx of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. This maladaptive inflammatory response outpaces the reparative capacity of lungs, resulting in profound inflammatory lung injury and hypoxemia. This proposal focuses on fundamental amplification mechanisms underlying the maladaptive inflammatory activation of the lung endothelium. Our central hypothesis is that the inflammatory response to threat signals such as the initial breaching of the endothelial plasma membrane by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rapid release of mitochondrial DNA by the injured mitochondria into the cytosol massively and acutely amplifies the inflammatory response and thus serves as essential feed-forward mechanisms for progression of acute lung injury (ALI). In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which the recently identified perforin Gasdermin D mediates endothelial plasma membrane pore formation and the mechanisms of activation of the K+ efflux ion channel TWIK2 that we have recently identified. We will address the role of amplifying K+ efflux on the severity and rapidity of endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and fulminant lung injury. In Aim 2, we will define another crucial amplification mechanism, the potentially important role of Gasdermin D-mediated mitochondrial (mt) membrane pore formation and the release of mtDNA, which may also catastrophically amplifiy lung injury via activation of Type I interferon signaling. These mechanistically driven studies will utilize genetic mouse models (endothelial specific knockout models in our labs) as well as comprehensive imaging, electrophysiological and physiological approaches and thus provide the framework for identifying novel endothelial amplification inflammatory mechanisms that induce lung vascular injury and ALI.

5R01MD014839-04,Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE),"This application proposes to examine a novel social epigenetic mechanism for racial inequality in lung cancer: Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE). We will examine the relationships between exposure to violence, inflammatory responses, smoking and epigenetic changes in protein arginine methyl transferases (PRMT6) that increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that smoking induces increased expression of PRMT6 in the lung epithelium. We also showed that overexpression of PRMT6 triggers spontaneous lung tumors in mice. Interestingly, we found that PRMT6 is upregulated among black men compared with white men in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thus we argue that the increased overexpression of PRMT6 among black men may explain a higher rate of lung cancer among black men compared with white men. While smoking is a key contributing factor for lung cancer, the frequency and amount of cigarette smoking are not necessarily higher for blacks, which suggests that other factors are responsible for racial disparity in lung cancer. Disproportionate social stress in black communities may be responsible for a higher rate of lung cancer among blacks. In particular, individuals living in excessive neighborhood violence are exposed to chronic stress, which may intensify the epigenetic changes for lung cancer. We hypothesize that exposure to neighborhood violence is social stress that increases biophysical inflammatory responses, which exacerbate the path between smoking, PRMT6 overexpression, and lung cancer. To examine the proposed social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity, first, we will test the independent effect of smoking and exposure to neighborhood violence, and the interaction of the two risks on PRMT6 expression using retrospective tissue samples from black and white lung cancer cases (Aim 2). Second, we will test the effect of exposure to violence on an inflammatory response (hair cortisol) and lung cancer screening outcomes by conducting a prospective survey and data collection with high-risk black men (Aim 3). Finally, we will build a multilevel, context-specific lung cancer risk profiles (Aim 1) that take into account not only individual behavioral risk (smoking), but neighborhood stress (exposure to violence), physiological inflammatory responses (increased cortisol), and molecular changes (PRMT6 overexpression). To develop such risk profiles, we utilize a composite population data approach to establish accurate counts of all individuals within census tracts with sociodemographic, behavioral, and neighborhood risk profiles. The strength of RECODE is its innovative approach to unveil a social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity. RECODE has the potential to transform understanding multilevel risks of lung cancer and improve the national lung cancer screening guidelines to reflect the social conditions of racial minority communities.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3013,433,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DK102960-09,'Metabolically Activated' Macrophages in Obesity and Insulin Resistance,"Visceral obesity associates with insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, which are major risk factors for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Although the cellular hallmark of obesity is neutral lipid expansion in adipocytes, adipose tissue of obese mice and humans also accumulate macrophages and other leukocytes. It is well accepted that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) play a critical role in systemic insulin resistance, suggesting that inflammatory mediators produced by ATMs are important factors linking excess fat mass to insulin sensitivity, glucose intolerance, and increased atherosclerotic risk. Understanding the mechanistic basis of the pro-inflammatory ATM phenotype and ATM function is required to devise new strategies for attenuating inflammation in metabolic disease. Pro-inflammatory pathways in ATMs are commonly attributed to classical activation (exposure to bacteria, M1), establishing molecular links between innate immunity and metabolic dysfunction. Recent studies, including work from our lab, suggest that M1 activation fails to accurately represent the complex phenotype of ATMs in vivo. We have shown that ATMs in obese adipose tissue from humans and mice adopt a unique ‘metabolically activated’ (MMe) phenotype that is distinct from the M1 phenotype. Inhibiting MMe activation of macrophages in vivo, attenuates ATM inflammation and improved glucose tolerance in mice. Moreover, the abundance of MMe-like ATMs in visceral fat is positively correlated with insulin resistance in patients controlled for adiposity. These findings underscore the pathophysiological importance of MMe macrophages in mice and humans. Although MMe and M1 macrophages are both characterized by increased expression of NFkB-induced inflammatory cytokines (ie. Tnfa, Il1b, Il6), our preliminary studies demonstrate that the upstream signaling cascades driving NFkB activation are remarkably distinct. We provide evidence for a novel fatty acid-driven, ROS-dependent, tyrosine-kinase mediated, pro-inflammatory signaling cascade in MMe macrophages. Targeting this ‘metabolically activated NFkB’ (Me-NFkB) pathway at any point selectively attenuates inflammatory cytokine expression by MMe macrophages. Our work has positioned us to test the innovative hypothesis that this Me-NFkB pathway promotes ATM inflammation and insulin resistance during obesity but is dispensable for inflammation required for host defense during infection. Specifically, we plan to 1) Delineate the Me-NFkB pathway that drives inflammation in MMe macrophages, and 2) Determine if targeting the Me-NFkB pathway improves insulin sensitivity in mice. Overall, our proposed studies aim to demonstrate that macrophage inflammation in metabolic disease can be attenuated without blocking these same cytokines in bacterial infection, a conceptual milestone that may lead to an improved anti-inflammatory strategy in the clinic.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2936,400,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R24EY033598-03,Alleviation of ER stress as a translational strategy to curb ocular viral infections,"Infection-associated blindness caused by herpesviruses is a leading cause of vision loss in the United States. Frontline therapies include the use of nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir which inhibit the viral thymidine kinase to restrict viral DNA replication. However, emergence of drug resistance and lack of strong corneal bioavailability have made it an urgent priority to develop alternative therapeutics. We have recently discovered a new mechanism through which herpesviruses, exemplified by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), propagate in the corneal epithelium. We have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized host protein cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) is essential to HSV-1 replication. Our findings shift the current understanding that CREB3 is only a cellular homolog of HSV-1 VP16. We showed that it is an important pro-viral factor that can be exploited to generate novel therapeutics against HSV infections. We for the first time showed that its modulation via a chemical chaperone 4- phenylbutyrate sodium (Na-PBA), can alleviate, ER stress, reduce CREB3 expression and inhibit viral replication. PBA is currently approved to treat urea cycle disorder. Our translational results are supported by strong in vivo murine data that suggests antiviral efficacy and topical dosage safety of Na-PBA. Due to the high sodium burden associated with Na-PBA administration, its unpalatability, and inability to penetrate sufficiently through corneal epithelium upon topical administration, we have developed various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations to overcome limitations associated with oral and topical delivery of Na-PBA. The purpose of this R24 application is to generate preclinical data in two animal models that support an IND application for repurposing PBA to treat ocular HSV infection. This will be achieved via 3 well thought, exhaustive specific aims. In the first aim, we will evaluate dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, and safety of orally and topically delivered Na-PBA solution and various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations. Furthermore, we will also determine oral and topical, and oral antiviral efficacy of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA nanoformulations in murine models of ocular HSV-1 infection. The second aim will use the most effective oral and topical formulation(s) and test their safety, PK, and efficacy in guinea pig and rabbit models of primary and reactivated ocular HSV-1 infection. Finally aim 3, we will investigate the potential of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA formulations to synergize with existing antiviral therapies to determine their potential as an add-on modality to the existing treatment. The latter is likely and significant since PBA is a rare drug that works via alleviating ER stress and aiding the host cell’s response to viral infection, and thereby reducing the chance for emergence of viral resistance. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team including scientists, clinicians, drug development and translation experts who can help us navigate through requisite FDA guidelines. PBA has the potential to become a safe and efficacious alternative to existing ocular antivirals very quickly.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3211,467,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5P50AA022538-10,Epigenetic Mechanisms of Positive  Affective State of AUD,"Project Summary As a hallmark of alcohol use disorder (AUD), the withdrawal syndrome includes both negative symptoms like anxiety and motivational symptoms such as craving for alcohol, which promotes relapse and alcohol seeking. Understanding how alcohol withdrawal changes brain physiology is an important step towards developing effective treatments to reduce alcohol abuse. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is an important brain area that projects to components of the extended amygdala, including the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Changes in the physiology of VTA neurons induced by withdrawal may underlie the alcohol-seeking during AUD. The sensitivity of neurons of the VTA to inhibition by gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is decreased during alcohol withdrawal but normalized by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, indicating epigenetic changes induced by withdrawal in the VTA may be amenable to pharmacological manipulation. Whole genome sequencing and molecular studies of this project identified a cluster of genes that encode cholesterol synthesis pathway enzymes that showed decreased expression during alcohol withdrawal, and are functionally relevant to decreased GABA sensitivity in VTA neurons during withdrawal. The proposed project plans to further characterize the role of specific epigenetic modifications in withdrawal-induced regulation of genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis, and the effect of these changes in withdrawal-induced GABA hyposensitivity and drinking behaviors. By using electrophysiological, behavioral, and state of the art molecular biological methods such as chemogenetics and CRISPR technology, we anticipate achieving the following goals: 1) to reveal novel epigenetic marks and changes in gene expression associated with chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal with whole genome approaches, 2) to examine whether decreased histone acetylation and increased histone methylation reduce expression of cholesterol synthesis enzymes in the VTA during withdrawal in a cell-type specific manner, and probe the role of cholesterol synthesis enzyme genes in withdrawal-related drinking behavior and GABA hyposensitivity, 3) to determine whether targeted epigenetic intervention counteracts withdrawal-induced phenotypes by using CRISPR to prevent decreases in histone acetylation on promoters of key cholesterol synthesis enzyme genes, and 4) to translate to post-mortem human alcoholic VTA the epigenetic dynamics and expression of genes related to GABA hyposensitivity that have been identified in the rat VTA. Ultimately, these studies are needed to understand epigenetic adaptation of VTA neurons involved in the positive affective state during alcohol withdrawal, and, with the other components of this Center, will provide a great deal of information on epigenetic mechanisms involved in withdrawal-induced brain changes, and possible pharmacological approaches toward more effective treatment of AUD.",2024,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2987,409,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01ES030576-05,The mechanistic role of METTL14 in UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the major DNA repair mechanism that removes bulky DNA damage products caused by UVB radiation as well as other environmental carcinogens. As a subtype of canonical NER, global genome NER (GG-NER) repairs DNA damage across the whole genome, and is essential for preventing skin cancer, the most common cancer in the US, as well as cancers in the brain and lungs 1-7. However, the molecular mechanism of regulating GG-NER capacity remains poorly understood. Recently, we discovered a novel role for METTL14 (methyltransferase-like 14), as a key component of the N6- methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methyltransferase and writer, in promoting GG-NER and suppressing tumor growth. m6A RNA methylation is the most abundant internal chemical modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) as well as long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). m6A modification regulates the fate of RNA and its functions, such as mRNA stability, nuclear processing, transport, localization, translation, primary microRNA processing, and RNA-protein interactions. The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which METTL14, as a key m6A writer, regulates GG-NER and UVB-induced skin cancer. Our preliminary data suggest that METTL14, as a key m6A writer protein, plays a critical role in regulating GG-NER and skin tumorigenesis. Thus we hypothesize that METTL14, as a key m6A writer, plays a critical role in GG-NER and UVB-induced skin cancer through posttranscriptionally regulating the expression of its essential target genes. To test this hypothesis, we will employ several new methods including transcriptome-wide m6A mapping, eCLIP-seq, and RIP-seq. In addition, we will use a new mouse model with skin-specific METTL14 deletion. Our hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism by which METTL14 regulates GG-NER. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism by which UVB radiation down-regulates METTL14. Aim 3 will determine the consequences of METTL14 inhibition in UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis in mice. Successful completion of our proposed project may vastly expand our knowledge of GG-NER regulation and tumor suppression by METTL14 and m6A RNA methylation, providing new opportunities for developing better strategies to prevent and treat skin cancer by targeting the METTL14 pathway. Caners arise in the skin more than in any other organ site, most likely due to environmental damage. In addition, our work here in GG-NER and METLL14 is not only significant in skin cancer, but is also applicable to other tumor types as well.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2581,393,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F31ES032337-03,Cellular stress sensing via biomolecular condensation,"Project Summary Background: Cells experience a wide array of environmental stresses, and must be able to sense and respond to changes in order to survive. The sensing process which occurs depends on the stress itself, and we have identified over 150 heat-sensitive proteins in S. cerevisiae which exhibit biomolecular condensation after temperature increase. Within this group, a conserved set of GTPases displays significant aggregation without the requirement of any other cellular components, opening up the possibility that these proteins have the ability to sense heat shock. Further, this set of proteins is connected to two fundamental functional responses which occur under heat stress -- transcriptional upregulation of heat shock genes and shutoff of ribosome biogenesis. Proteins that are highly sensitive to heat may act as long-unidentified sensors upstream of massive functional changes within the cell, and serve as heat sensing candidates for this proposal. Long viewed as a toxic consequence of harsh environmental conditions, recent work has shown that biomolecular condensate formation is non-random, adaptive, and reversible. With this emerging view, diseases like dementia and ALS which are associated with the accumulation of non-membrane bound protein aggregates might be the result of an aberrant activation of stress sensing pathways, indicating that our understanding of the disease pathology may need to be reevaluated. Specific Aims: 1: Are candidates sufficient to induce the transcriptional response in vivo? 2: What is the mechanism for heat sensing? 3: What is the functional relevance of candidate condensation on ribosome production? Study Design: I will take advantage of a cryophilic yeast which execute their heat-induced cellular responses at lower temperatures than S. cerevisiae. The cryophilic yeast likely contain homologous sensor proteins with increased sensitivity at lower temperatures. I will replace the endogenous sensor candidate genes with their cryophilic homologs and assay the ability of the recombinant S. cerevisiae to upregulate the production of heat- specific transcripts and attenuate ribosome biogenesis. I will reconstitute the components of these functional responses in vitro and test whether the condensation of candidate sensors can affect either response. Condensation of candidate sensors will also be studied in vitro using biochemical and biophysical assays to investigate their intrinsic ability to sense heat to describe the mechanistic underpinnings of sensing. Training: This research will be performed with Dr. D. Allan Drummond at the University of Chicago and will build upon my experimental skills by first characterizing the functional relevance of biomolecular condensation in environmental stress sensing and further expanding into understanding the biophysical mechanism. This training will prepare me for a future career studying how environmental stresses shape cellular behavior.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2964,427,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01AI144094-05,Development of Intestinal Polyreactive IgA B Cells,"A large fraction of the intestinal commensal microbiota is coated with IgA antibodies in homeostatic conditions, but the strategy and the mechanisms deployed to confront the immense diversity of bacterial antigens have remained elusive. Converging studies indicate that homeostatic IgA responses employ a highly polyreactive repertoire to bind broad but distinct subsets of microbiota. These antibody responses develop in the presence of limited T cell help, with low rate of somatic mutations and little affinity maturation. This new perspective contrasts with the classical paradigm of T cell-dependent, high-affinity antibody responses elicited by mucosal pathobionts, pathogens and vaccines, and provides a simple immunological solution to the challenge of microbiota antigenic complexity. It also raises several fundamental issues, including how polyreactive specificities are generated and selected in the IgA repertoire, and how they coexist or overlap with other immune responses during homeostasis and disease. This project addresses these issues by (i) generating polyreactive IgA knock-in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to (ii) understand the development and differentiation of polyreactive IgA precursor B cells and (iii) to study the function of polyreactive IgA at the clonal level in the context of intestinal and extraintestinal challenges. These studies will clarify a major gap in our understanding of polyreactive B cell repertoires, address a challenge to existing dogmas of antibody specificity and tolerance, and develop new knowledge, concepts and tools for a better understanding of intestinal immunity, inflammatory bowel diseases and oral vaccines.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,1677,237,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL155909-02,Mechanosensitive M7G epitranscriptome in endothelial health and disease,"Project Summary RNA chemical modifications, collectively referred to as the “epitranscriptome”, have recently emerged as a novel layer of molecular control of gene expression. Most epitranscriptomic studies address N6- methyladenosine (m6A) of mRNA in human cancers. The molecular identity of endothelial mRNA epitranscriptome and its potential role in regulating vascular functions remains a major knowledge gap. Recent studies suggested that mammalian mRNAs are broadly chemically modified and mRNA modifications occur in a cell-type and cell-state dependent manner. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal (outside of the 5’ cap) methylation in mammalian mRNA, has been linked to critical biological processes such as proliferation, development, and stem cell differentiation. Only few recent studies addressed the potential role of mRNA m6A in cardiomyocyte remodeling and endothelial activation. We recently discovered the presence of a new chemical modification, N7-methylguanosine (m7G) in mammalian mRNA. Systematic m7G mapping in endothelial mRNA and its potential role in vascular pathophysiology is an unexplored territory. Vascular endothelium is dynamically regulated by blood flow via mechano-transduction mechanisms. Endothelial activation by disturbed flow contributes to a wide range of vascular diseases. Atherosclerosis preferentially develops in arterial sites where endothelium is activated by local disturbed flow whereas unidirectional flow promotes endothelial health. Current atherosclerosis therapies mainly target systematic risk factors but not the vasculature per se. This underscores the significance and unique opportunity to identify and target novel mechanosensitive mechanisms in vascular endothelium. We have generated very strong data demonstrating that the mRNA m7G is dynamically regulated in endothelium by hemodynamics. Unidirectional flow (UF) markedly increases m7G but not m6A in endothelial mRNAs. Moreover, Methyltransferase-Like 7A (METTL7A) is a novel m7G writer governing the UF-induced mRNA m7G methylation in endothelium. The overall goal of this project is to delineate the novel molecular mechanisms by which mechano-sensitive METTL7A governs endothelial mRNA m7G and regulates vascular functions in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we will devise innovative precision nanomedicine approaches targeting METTL7A-mediated pathways to treat atherosclerosis.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2415,322,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01GM079265-13,Actin Cytoskeleton Network Self-Organization,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Cells assemble functionally diverse actin cytoskeleton networks with distinct architectures and dynamics to drive fundamental processes such as polarization, endocytosis, motility and division. The specific characteristics of different actin filament networks (actin filament density, organization and dynamics) are determined through the coordination action of specific sets of actin binding proteins (ABPs) with complementary binding properties. Most investigations primarily focus on individual F-actin networks. However, this provides limited overall understanding of F-actin network organization and function because cells typically assemble and use multiple F-actin networks simultaneously within the same cytoplasm. Consequently, F-actin networks must self-organize from a common pool of shared actin monomers and overlapping sets of ABPs. We have predicted that there are important interactions (cross talk) between networks that are critical for their form and function. Our long-term goal is to discover the direct and indirect interactions between self-organized F-actin networks, which are critical for establishing their unique identities and functions within a common cytoplasm, and to determine the underlying molecular mechanistic principles that govern these interactions. We are investigating two major actin cytoskeleton self-organization questions. The first is to determine the mechanisms by which the size and density of F-actin networks are regulated by competition for a limiting amount of actin monomers (Aim I). Although unassembled G-actin was not thought to be limiting, we systematically showed that competition for G-actin helps control the size and density of competitive F-actin networks in fission yeast, and that the actin monomer protein profilin plays a major role in regulating competition for limiting G-actin. Our goal is to determine the underlying mechanism by which profilin and other ABPs contribute to the proper distribution of G-actin between functionally diverse actin cytoskeleton networks. The second is to determine how diverse F-actin networks acquire the specific set of ABPs whose complementary biochemical activities help define their form and function (Aim II). We will investigate the underlying intrinsic molecular mechanisms by which ABPs self-sort to particular F-actin networks within a common cytoplasm, including (1) the contribution of competition and cooperation between ABPs for associating with actin filaments, and (2) whether actin assembly factors initiate self-sorting by biasing the association of particular ABPs.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2610,358,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5R01DK104942-08,"Monogenic Diabetes: Next Generation Diagnosis, Treatment and Complications","Diabetes mellitus affects close to 30 million people in the United States, causing significant morbidity and mortality and economic burden to the healthcare system. A critical aspect of addressing this burden is optimizing glycemic outcomes through accurate diabetes classification and management. This concept is most precisely applied to monogenic diabetes, where genetic diagnosis directs gene-targeted therapy resulting in improved clinical outcomes and will inform the implementation of similar future approaches to type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Monogenic diabetes remains the best example of personalized medicine in diabetes, yet it is usually misdiagnosed and therefore inappropriately treated. Over the last four years, enrollment in the University of Chicago Monogenic Diabetes Registry has surged to over 1000 with causal genetic variants, including 344 individuals whose diagnosis was made possible only through our research funding in the last four years. We are the largest registry of monogenic diabetes in the Western Hemisphere and we have detailed the clinical and cost-effectiveness of diabetes precision medicine in over 30 publications. Our overarching goals continue to be: to accelerate efficient diagnosis, to advance progress in understanding, and to inform clinical guidelines in the management of monogenic forms of diabetes, through cumulative longitudinal follow-up and pragmatic cohort studies from our Registry. We propose to bolster our innovative efforts by establishing a genetic testing algorithm that accurately identifies appropriate individuals for single gene Sanger sequencing and prioritizes massively parallel sequencing for those who would otherwise require iterative gene screening. Additionally, we will adapt the Registry platform to improve engagement via a participant-facing portal and ensure sustainability through adaptive change garnered from Registry insights. Finally, we will engage current Registry participants to identify barriers to sharing positive monogenic diabetes results with relatives, which will guide the development of a structured approach to cascade genetic testing, as well as cost-effectiveness analyses, to improve enrollment of family members for genetic testing. These projects will have a broad direct impact by improving healthcare provider and commercial genetic testing laboratory practices in the cost-effective diagnosis of monogenic diabetes. We aim to decrease participant burden and improve data quality and completeness while advancing the evaluation and surveillance infrastructure of the Registry to allow accurate conclusions about the benefits of targeted gene therapy in monogenic diabetes. Furthermore, we aim to develop improved strategies to extend the benefits of precision medicine through cascade testing.

5R01GM117372-08,Chaperone-Assisted Structure Determination of Membrane Proteins,"Membrane proteins are complex molecular machines whose functions are governed by sets of programed conformational transitions. Attempts to establish the fundamental molecular mechanisms that link membrane protein structure and dynamics to functions they induce have been thwarted by a number of seemingly insurmountable technical barriers. Principal among these barriers is that the conformational transitions are too transient to be studied using traditional structural biology techniques. To overcome these barriers, we have developed and implemented a set of novel methodologies and reagents based on phage display generated synthetic antibodies (sABs). Customize phage display selection strategies enable generation of sABs endowed with special properties, for instance, conformation and regio-specificity. These reagents have been used to study the molecular properties of transient states of membrane proteins at unprecedented detail. While sABs have demonstrated efficacy as crystallization chaperones, their use in cryo-EM as powerful fiducial marks, adding 50 kDa to the particle and their ability to trap conformation states, is especially impactful in studies linking conformational transitions and function. This is particularly relevant for smaller membrane proteins (< 50 kDa), which include ion channels transporters and receptors. These constitute the largest class of biomedically relevant target systems, but are recalcitrant to crystallization and are far too small for cryo-EM analysis. Building on our current technology platform, we propose to design and deploy a set of higher-order sAB constructions that will serve to increase the size, rigidity and, in some cases, the symmetry of the target membrane protein. These sAB-based entities will be engineered to serve as prefabricated modules of assembly. They are targeted to specific epitopes that have been introduced into the membrane protein and thus, can be universally employed irrespective of the system they are applied to. The power of the approach is that these “universal” sABs can be added to the molecule of interest in a “plug and play” fashion allowing any investigator access to the powerful technology without requiring generating target specific sABs. To test and evaluate these novel sAB modules, we will use a set of high value small membrane proteins provided by investigators from our collaborator network. These systems have been recalcitrant to structural analysis using traditional approaches and thus, will provide a good measure of the performance of the chaperone-assisted structure determination technologies. An important byproduct is that these structures will provide valuable information about linkages between structure and dynamics that had been out of reach previously. !",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2779,400,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

ACPAs not only cause ocular surface disease, but also stimulate formation of NETs, thus creating a self-perpetuating cycle of chronic inflammation on the ocular surface. We present an innovative pathophysiological concept: DED is characterized by breach of self-tolerance towards citrullinated antigens with generation of autoantibodies (ACPAs) and NETs could represent a source of citrullinated antigens fueling the ACPA autoimmune response over the ocular surface. We performed a first-in-human pilot clinical trial and showed that ocular surface immune globulin (OSIG) eye drops, formulated from pooled human immune globulin products (IVIG), were safe and efficacious in treating DED patients. Our findings shift the current paradigm that focuses on T-cell mediated inflammation as central to the pathophysiology of DED to also include autoimmune inflammation that is driven by post- translational modifications in self-proteins (citrullination) and autoantibodies (ACPAs). The purpose of this R24 application is to produce preclinical data that supports a commercial Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The longer-term goal is for testing the efficacy of OSIG eye drops in clinical trials and positioning OSIG eye drops as a new topical biologic immunotherapy for DED patients. Therefore, in Aim A, we seek to develop an optimum OSIG eye drop formulation using Quality by Design (QbD) principles, test critical quality attributes (CQAs) and GMP manufacture clinical supplies. In order to use OSIG ophthalmic formulation in human, an FDA IND is a prerequisite, therefore, in Aim B, we propose to perform pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo toxicology and efficacy studies using the OSIG ophthalmic formulation to meet regulatory requirements for IND studies. In Aim C, we propose to perform a clinical study to identify DED subtypes, clinical presentations and patient characteristics that are most associated with ACPAs or NETs, hence most likely to show therapeutic benefit with OSIG therapy. To successfully achieve these three Aims, we have established a highly qualified, multi-disciplinary team that is experienced in ophthalmic drug development, and FDA processes and regulations. If the aims of this grant proposal are successfully achieved, we will be one-step closer to introducing the first immunotherapy for ocular surface diseases into clinical practice.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2738,401,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01MD014839-03,Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE),"This application proposes to examine a novel social epigenetic mechanism for racial inequality in lung cancer: Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment (RECODE). We will examine the relationships between exposure to violence, inflammatory responses, smoking and epigenetic changes in protein arginine methyl transferases (PRMT6) that increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that smoking induces increased expression of PRMT6 in the lung epithelium. We also showed that overexpression of PRMT6 triggers spontaneous lung tumors in mice. Interestingly, we found that PRMT6 is upregulated among black men compared with white men in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thus we argue that the increased overexpression of PRMT6 among black men may explain a higher rate of lung cancer among black men compared with white men. While smoking is a key contributing factor for lung cancer, the frequency and amount of cigarette smoking are not necessarily higher for blacks, which suggests that other factors are responsible for racial disparity in lung cancer. Disproportionate social stress in black communities may be responsible for a higher rate of lung cancer among blacks. In particular, individuals living in excessive neighborhood violence are exposed to chronic stress, which may intensify the epigenetic changes for lung cancer. We hypothesize that exposure to neighborhood violence is social stress that increases biophysical inflammatory responses, which exacerbate the path between smoking, PRMT6 overexpression, and lung cancer. To examine the proposed social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity, first, we will test the independent effect of smoking and exposure to neighborhood violence, and the interaction of the two risks on PRMT6 expression using retrospective tissue samples from black and white lung cancer cases (Aim 2). Second, we will test the effect of exposure to violence on an inflammatory response (hair cortisol) and lung cancer screening outcomes by conducting a prospective survey and data collection with high-risk black men (Aim 3). Finally, we will build a multilevel, context-specific lung cancer risk profiles (Aim 1) that take into account not only individual behavioral risk (smoking), but neighborhood stress (exposure to violence), physiological inflammatory responses (increased cortisol), and molecular changes (PRMT6 overexpression). To develop such risk profiles, we utilize a composite population data approach to establish accurate counts of all individuals within census tracts with sociodemographic, behavioral, and neighborhood risk profiles. The strength of RECODE is its innovative approach to unveil a social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity. RECODE has the potential to transform understanding multilevel risks of lung cancer and improve the national lung cancer screening guidelines to reflect the social conditions of racial minority communities.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3013,433,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01NS116365-04,Hox-dependent mechanisms for establishment and maintenance of motor neuron terminal identity,"Defects in motor neuron (MN) function or survival result in severe human pathologies, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy, with distinct MN subtypes differing in their susceptibility to disease. There is currently no effective treatment for these disorders, in part due to a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms that allow distinct MN subtypes to acquire and maintain their function-defining properties. The continuous expression, from development through adulthood, of subtype-specific terminal identity genes (e.g., genes coding for ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, signaling molecules) defines the unique, functional features of a given MN subtype throughout life. How these genes are induced and maintained is poorly understood. This proposal uses a novel approach to specifically focus on the transcriptional regulation of MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes. The goal of this proposal is to uncover conserved, gene regulatory mechanisms that establish during development, and maintain throughout life, the expression of MN subtype-specific terminal features. To this end, this proposal combines the strengths of two model organisms: the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse Mus musculus. By studying how C. elegans ventral nerve cord (VNC) MNs acquire their subtype-specific features, we discovered a gene regulatory mechanism that involves the intersectional activity of highly conserved transcription factors. We found that the transcription factor UNC-3 induces and maintains the expression of terminal identity genes in all VNC MN subtypes. However, UNC-3 does not act alone. It requires co-factors in the form of Hox proteins that act synergistically with UNC-3 to activate expression of terminal identity genes in distinct MN subtypes along the anterior-posterior axis of the VNC. We observed Hox expression in developing and adult MNs, suggesting that Hox proteins, similar to UNC-3, not only induce, but also maintain expression of terminal identity genes. The unpublished data in this application indicate that Hox proteins, in mice, also control expression of terminal identity genes in spinal MNs, suggesting evolutionary conservation of our C. elegans findings. This proposal aims to uncover the function of Hox proteins in adult C. elegans MNs (Aim 1), decipher the gene regulatory mechanisms downstream of Hox in C. elegans MNs (Aim 2), and test the hypothesis that a mouse Hox protein (Hoxc8), similar to its C. elegans orthologs, is required to induce and maintain expression of terminal identity genes in MNs of the brachial spinal cord (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed activities will advance our understanding of how distinct MN subtypes become and remain functional, which may provide new insights into the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of MN disorders.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2867,421,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R01AG079894-01,Image-based cerebrovascular network snythesis(iCNS) to model Alzheimer's Disease,"Significant resources on age-related neurodegeneration are directed toward animal research in the assumption that results will inform our understanding of parallel processes in human. Yet, no reliable method exists to accurately translate cerebral blood flow or metabolic data from animal to human. For lack of rigorous mathematical methods for cerebral metabolic parameters between species, translation of valuable research data from mouse to human remains guesswork. There is a need for a predictive computational framework that quantifies cerebral blood flow and metabolism in normal and diseased human brain states. Our long term goal is to quantify fundamental physiological processes of aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), so that their effects can be slowed or even partially reversed. The objective is to expand the utility of MRI analysis by magnifying the detectability of age-related microcirculatory changes in humans with a mechanistic mathematical framework. It is our hypothesis that age and AD related changes in the microcirculation also generate macroscopic perturbations of hemodynamic and/or oxygen perfusion states that will be detectable with advanced MRI techniques, when guided by rigorous brain simulations over all relevant length scales. The rationale is that critical physiological metrics for dysfunction in aged brains (=aging biomarkers) will be exposed by systematic exploration and simulation of fundamental hemodynamic and metabolic processes. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1) Assess the predictive value of mechanistic modeling by simulating the link between capillary stalling, vascular tracer transit properties, and tissue oxygen delivery, and validate predictions using advanced microscopic imaging in mouse. We determine the effects of aging and AD in aged rodent brains. Aim 2) Develop mechanistic multiscale model for predicting the impact of cerebral perfusion on oxygen metabolism in the human cortex under normal and pathological conditions. Anatomically detailed mechanistic models of cerebral circulation in human will predict the effect of structural and functional changes in AD on oxygen extraction in the human brain with MRI. Aim 3) Assess the predictive value of mechanistic multiscale modeling to quantify microvascular properties across the human brain cortex in health and disease using advanced MRI. To validate the mechanistic translation from mouse to human, we will measure age-related metabolic functions in cohorts of aged and Alzheimer patients. We identify hemodynamic and metabolic metrics (=biomarkers) that correlate with cognitive decline This contribution is significant because it will predict how changes in vascular morphometry and metabolism lead to neurological decline. It will identify biomarkers visible in noninvasive diagnostic imaging in humans that signal age-related deterioration before symptoms develop. The mechanistic framework relating data acquired in mouse to human will dramatically boost the relevance of animal data for human medicine.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3072,438,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R21AI173863-01,Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2: the role of HLA class I,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since December 2019, coordinated research efforts have provided a wealth of critical data that have enhanced our ability to diagnose and treat COVID-19. To date, however, much of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remain elusive. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains nine independent open reading frames (ORFs) coding for proteins that are not essential for viral replication but seem to exert important functions in modulating host antiviral immunity. Of these accessory proteins, the ORF8 protein stands out for its unique characteristics. ORF8 is a highly variable protein among SARS-related CoVs. ORF8 also appears to be involved in a network of host-pathogen interactions inside infected cells: ORF8 impairs immune pathways such as antigen presentation, interferon type I, and nuclear factor-kB, as well as possibly activate growth pathways. A central question is how ORF8 mediates interactions with multiple host protein targets. Towards this goal, we are investigating ORF8 interaction with major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules. It was shown recently that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 suppresses CD8+ T cell responses by downregulating MHC I molecules, both in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that ORF8 suppresses surface expression of HLA-A and HLA-B molecules to protect infected cells from recognition by CD8+ T cells, but spares HLA-C and HLA-E to avoid activation of natural killer (NK) cells. The possibility that ORF8 displays a locus specificity toward MHC I would provide a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 to walk a fine line between adaptive and innate immunity. Specifically, we will undertake an analysis of interactions between ORF8 and MHC I by using a panel of HLA- A, -B, -C, and -E molecules, and also determine if ORF8 selectively downregulates MHC I in relevant cell systems (Aim 1). We will extend these studies to ORF8 variants that have been positively selected during the course of the pandemic and evaluate if and how these mutations affect MHC I binding and downregulation (Aim 2). The successful completion of these Aims is expected to uncover unknown features of ORF8 and elucidate its role in suppressing antigen presentation, as well as inform us on the selective pressure that MHC I exerts on SARS-CoV-2. The immediate and long-term impact of our proposed research is high. This is the first study that: (1) characterizes molecular interaction of ORF8 with a host protein; and (2) evaluates clinically relevant ORF8 variants. By studying the immune interactions underlying ORF8-mediated downregulation of MHC I, we will increase our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 derails cellular immunity. Importantly, our study will stimulate similar investigations of other ORF8-interactors, providing novel opportunities for the development of therapeutics directed against ORF8 or its host targets.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3010,453,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R24EY033598-02,Alleviation of ER stress as a translational strategy to curb ocular viral infections,"Infection-associated blindness caused by herpesviruses is a leading cause of vision loss in the United States. Frontline therapies include the use of nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir which inhibit the viral thymidine kinase to restrict viral DNA replication. However, emergence of drug resistance and lack of strong corneal bioavailability have made it an urgent priority to develop alternative therapeutics. We have recently discovered a new mechanism through which herpesviruses, exemplified by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), propagate in the corneal epithelium. We have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized host protein cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) is essential to HSV-1 replication. Our findings shift the current understanding that CREB3 is only a cellular homolog of HSV-1 VP16. We showed that it is an important pro-viral factor that can be exploited to generate novel therapeutics against HSV infections. We for the first time showed that its modulation via a chemical chaperone 4- phenylbutyrate sodium (Na-PBA), can alleviate, ER stress, reduce CREB3 expression and inhibit viral replication. PBA is currently approved to treat urea cycle disorder. Our translational results are supported by strong in vivo murine data that suggests antiviral efficacy and topical dosage safety of Na-PBA. Due to the high sodium burden associated with Na-PBA administration, its unpalatability, and inability to penetrate sufficiently through corneal epithelium upon topical administration, we have developed various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations to overcome limitations associated with oral and topical delivery of Na-PBA. The purpose of this R24 application is to generate preclinical data in two animal models that support an IND application for repurposing PBA to treat ocular HSV infection. This will be achieved via 3 well thought, exhaustive specific aims. In the first aim, we will evaluate dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, and safety of orally and topically delivered Na-PBA solution and various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations. Furthermore, we will also determine oral and topical, and oral antiviral efficacy of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA nanoformulations in murine models of ocular HSV-1 infection. The second aim will use the most effective oral and topical formulation(s) and test their safety, PK, and efficacy in guinea pig and rabbit models of primary and reactivated ocular HSV-1 infection. Finally aim 3, we will investigate the potential of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA formulations to synergize with existing antiviral therapies to determine their potential as an add-on modality to the existing treatment. The latter is likely and significant since PBA is a rare drug that works via alleviating ER stress and aiding the host cell’s response to viral infection, and thereby reducing the chance for emergence of viral resistance. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team including scientists, clinicians, drug development and translation experts who can help us navigate through requisite FDA guidelines. PBA has the potential to become a safe and efficacious alternative to existing ocular antivirals very quickly.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3211,467,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01GM104032-08,Mechanical Regulation of Cell Adhesion by Dynamic Cytoskeletal Assemblies,"Project Summary Mechanical Regulation of Cell Adhesion by Dynamic Cytoskeletal Assemblies Epithelial tissue is built by dynamic adhesions, cell-cell junctions, that connect neighboring cells to maintain tissue cohesion and barrier function yet also allow dynamic processes like wound healing and tissue morphogenesis. Contractile forces generated within the actomyosin cytoskeleton are transmitted to cell-cell junctions to control the local cell shape and motions that sculpt tissue morphogenesis and initiate downstream signaling pathways that control cell fate. Understanding how the biophysical properties of cell-cell junctions are regulated has widespread implications for understanding and treating defects during embryonic development, for tissue engineering and the diagnosis and treatment of metastatic tumors. This proposal leverages innovative combination of cell biophysics, molecular cell biology, live cell imaging, mathematical modeling and optogenetics to investigate how RhoA signals regulate contractile forces to drive changes in cell-cell junction length that control cell shape and, ultimately, tissue morphogenesis. We propose experiments to elucidate how force-dependent process regulating actomyosin contractility, membrane remodeling and RhoA signaling feedback to each other to control junction length and length changes. We approach this problem by integrating molecular cell biology approaches with advanced quantitative imaging of cytoskeletal dynamics and biophysical measurements. By obtaining kinetic and kinematic (motion) signatures of proteins at varying levels of tension, we identify mechanisms of force transmission within focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton. We then collaborate closely with theoretical physicists to test the predictions of analytical theory and simulations with our quantitative biophysical measurements. This work builds a biophysical understanding of cell adhesion, tension and shape that, ultimately, will provide the framework for theories and models of tissue morphogenesis that will have predictive power in understanding in complex physiological processes. More generally, the strategies developed in this proposal can be applied more generally to understand how force-sensitive feedbacks within the cytoskeletal conspire to facilitate cell morphogenic processes. This will enable the development of improved therapies to treat diseases involved in tissue homeostasis that currently remain elusive by solely treating molecular targets.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2508,330,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R35GM144278-02,Function and Regulation of Stress-Induced Adaptive Condensates,"Project Summary A conceptual and empirical revolution is occurring in our understanding of the eukaryotic heat-shock response. Heat shock has long been conceived of as a proteotoxic stress, triggering formation of toxic aggregates of denatured proteins, which must be cleaned up by induced heat shock proteins. Recent results from our group and others have established a complementary paradigm: temperature acts as a physiological signal, triggering the adaptive formation of biomolecular condensates with specific cellular functions, and the condensation process is regulated by heat shock proteins. Crucially, in the proteotoxic model, aggregates are trash, but in the adaptive condensation model, they are functional treasure. Using an integrated set of biochemical, cell biological, and evolutionary approaches established over the past decade, we are pursuing three linked areas: 1) identifying and dissecting the cellular functions of particular heat-shock and stress-induced condensates of protein and mRNA; 2) studying the regulation of condensation and dispersal, focusing on the specificity of physiological condensates and their remodeling and reversal by stress-induced molecular chaperones; and 3) probing the sensation and transduction of temperature into adaptive responses in fungi which rely on warm-blooded hosts for growth or dispersal, and in the temperature-dependent activation of cells in the vertebrate immune system during fever. In addition to fundamental insights into the operation and organization of eukaryotic cells, these studies promise to shed light on intracellular aggregation processes known to be dysregulated during neurodegenerative disease, uncover new mechanisms for the control of fungi, and provide new molecular insight into how fever promotes immune-cell activation.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,1812,252,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5R01AI146099-04,Mechanisms by which intestinal bacteria contribute to maintenance of tolerance in food allergy,"The prevalence of food allergy has experienced an unprecedented increase in Western societies, rising by as much as 20% in a recent ten-year period. We have previously described a role for mucosa- associated commensal bacteria in protection from allergic sensitization in mice. To understand how the microbiota regulates allergic disease in humans, we colonized germ free mice with human bacteria from the feces of healthy or cow’s milk allergic (CMA) infants. Our data shows that colonization with bacteria derived from healthy human infant feces is sufficient to protect mice against sensitization to the cow’s milk allergen b-lactoglobulin (BLG), whereas colonization with feces from human CMA infants fails to protect. By analyzing operational taxonomic units (OTUs) differentially abundant between our human fecal donors (4 healthy, 4 CMA) we have defined a microbial signature that distinguishes the CMA and heathy populations in both the human donors and the colonized mice, emphasizing the clinical relevance of our gnotobiotic model. RNASeq analysis of ileal intestinal epithelial cells revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that distinguished healthy- and CMA-colonized mice across all donors. Correlation of ileal OTUs with DEGs in the ileum of healthy-colonized mice identified a Clostridial species, Anaerostipes caccae, that protected against an allergic response to food. Our findings demonstrate a causal role for the healthy infant microbiota in protection against food allergy and suggest that interventions that modulate bacterial communities may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this disease. In this proposal we will further refine our OTU signature and examine whether the CMA infant microbiome is an atopic microbiome in Aim 1. Aim 2 will explore how healthy intestinal bacteria influence the response to food allergens by examining their impact on innate lymphoid cell function, early T/B priming and effector T cell differentiation and migration. The robust, pre-clinical gnotobiotic models we describe will provide an ideal system in which to identify key host-microbial interactions that contribute to the maintenance of tolerance to dietary antigen in food allergy.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,2228,327,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01MH124723-03,Primary Care Based Depression Prevention in Adolescents: Intervention Optimization in Preparation for Implementation Study,"With more than 13% of adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorders each year, prevention of depressive disorders has become a key priority for the NIMH. Unfortunately, we have no widely available interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality (e.g. public health impact). To address this need, we developed a multi-health system “collaboratory” to develop and evaluate the primary care based-technology “behavioral vaccine,” Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive-Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal Therapy (CATCH-IT) (14 adolescent, 4 parent modules). Using this health-system collaboratory model, CATCH-IT demonstrated evidence of efficacy in prevention of depressive episodes in phase-three clinical trials in the United States and China. However, like many “package” interventions, CATCH-IT became larger and more complex across efficacy trials. Thus, adolescents and parents were less willing to complete all 18 modules, suggesting adolescent dose “tolerability” issues (e.g. satisfaction, acceptability and resource use, “time as cost”). Similarly, primary care practices have “scalability” challenges (acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost), resulting in declining REACH (percent of at-risk youth who complete intervention). To prepare for implementation studies and dissemination, we need to address adolescent tolerability and practice/health system scalability, while preserving efficacy. Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) uses a systematic analytic approach and a factorial randomized clinical trial design to address efficacy, tolerability, and scalability, simultaneously. We will use a MOST approach to optimize CATCH-IT for the prevention of depression (indicated prevention, i.e., elevated symptoms of depression) in practices and health systems representative of US geography and population. The theoretically grounded components of CATCH-IT selected for study and optimization are: behavioral activation, cognitive therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and parent program. We will use a 4-factor (2x2x2x2) fully crossed factorial design with N=16 cells (20 per cell, 15% dropout) to evaluate the contribution of each component. We propose to randomize N=378 (N=189) from each health system site. The at-risk youth will be high school students 13 through 18 years old, not currently experiencing a mood disorder, but with subsyndromal symptoms of depression (moderate to high risk). Using the efficient factorial design, we can assess the contribution to prevention efficacy of each component. Thus, the MOST study design will enable us to eliminate non-contributing components while preserving efficacy and to optimize CATCH-IT by strengthening tolerability and scalability by reducing “resource use.” By reducing resource use, we anticipate satisfaction and acceptability will also increase, preparing the way for an implementation trial and eventual US Preventive Services Task Force endorsement to support dissemination. Thus, our primary question is whether one component, or perhaps two, can demonstrate an equivalent effect to combinations of other components in terms of efficacy, whilst also demonstrating superior adolescent/family tolerability scalability over a 12-month follow-up.",2023,,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,3241,434,1.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01GM135391-05,Molecular mechanisms controlling kinetochore-microtubule attachments during mitosis,"Project Summary: Mitotic cells assemble two key cellular structures to segregate the chromosomes equally between the two daughter cells - the mitotic spindle and the kinetochores. Kinetochores are multi-protein complexes that form at the centromeres of the chromosomes during mitosis and serve as attachment sites for microtubules [MT(s)] of the mitotic spindle. The kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) interface generates force that drives chromosome alignment and segregation. The current focus of the Varma lab is on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in kMT attachments and their contribution to accurate chromosome segregation. During early mitotic prometaphase, kinetochores initially attach to the MT lattice laterally. These lateral attachments are subsequently converted into end-on attachments when sister kinetochores become stably attached to the plus-ends of spindle MTs in metaphase. Studies have shown that the initial capture and lateral sliding of kinetochores on MTs is driven by dynein, a minus-end-directed motor. The end-on kinetochore- microtubule (kMT) attachment formation and its stabilization is mediated by the MT-binding kinetochore complex, Ndc80. Our 1st major goal is to determine how the kinetochore complexes required for these two alternate modes of MT attachment coordinate to produce dynamic kMT attachments required for proper chromosome alignment. Our recent work has provided evidence for an antagonistic relationship between dynein and the Ndc80 complexes in humans during mitosis. Our unpublished results suggest that dynein and the Ndc80 complex synergize for efficient chromosome capture and for stabilizing kMT attachments during metaphase, but the mechanism for this coordination is unclear. The centromere-distal region of the Ndc80 complex at the N-terminal domain of the Hec1 subunit has been identified as the MT-binding site required to stabilize kMT attachments. Phosphorylation of this region by Aurora B kinase negatively regulates the strength of kMT attachments. Our work has discovered that in addition to the N-terminal domain, the more internal loop domain has a major role in attachment. The attachment requires the loop domain-mediated kinetochore recruitment of the replication licensing protein Cdt1, which we find is a novel MT-binding protein at kinetochores. Our work also demonstrates that the binding of Cdt1 to MTs is negatively regulated by Aurora B. Our unpublished studies demonstrate that Cdt1 synergizes with another MT-associated protein (MAP) at kinetochores, the Ska complex that has been shown to promote efficient binding of the Ndc80 complex to kMTs. Our 2nd major goal is to determine how different kinetochore MAPs mediate robust interaction between the Ndc80 complex and MTs for the stabilization of kMT attachments during metaphase to drive accurate chromosome segregation. In the long term, our lab aims to identify novel mechanisms controlling kMT attachments and the pathways that regulate this process, while also establishing novel model systems and approaches to study these processes.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3081,445,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL155953-03,Role of mRNA-binding protein tristetraprolin in cardiac mRNA regulation and the development of heart failure,"Heart failure (HF) is a major health epidemic in developed countries, however, its underlying pathology is not well characterized. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a tandem zinc finger protein that binds to AU-rich elements (ARE) in the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA molecules, and induces their degradation. Global TTP knockout (KO) mice display systemic inflammation, since TNFα mRNA is normally degraded by TTP, and deletion of TTP leads to elevated TNFα levels. Thus, very few studies have assessed the role of TTP in metabolism despite its original discovery as an insulin-inducible gene, and genetic studies linking TTP to metabolic syndrome. We are addressing this fundamental gap in knowledge, and our strong preliminary data suggest critical activities by TTP in cardiac metabolism and the development of HF. Specifically, we have shown that TTP inhibits fatty acid (FA) and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism (independent of its effects on inflammation), and reduces the mRNA levels of key proteins in these processes, i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and branched-chain α–ketoacid acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC)-E2 subunits. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TTP inhibits cardiac FA and BCAA metabolism by binding to and degrading PPARα and BCKDC-E2 mRNAs, and that TTP exacerbates the development of HF by impairing FA and BCAA metabolism. In Aim 1, we will assess whether TTP inhibits cardiac FA metabolism by binding to PPARα mRNA and promoting its degradation. We will assess whether TTP binds to PPARα mRNA by performing RNA co-immunopreciptation (co-IP) and deletion studies of PPARα 3’-UTR AREs. We will also measure FA uptake and metabolism in the hearts from cardiac-specific TTP KO (csTTP-KO) mice, and will determine whether these changes are through PPARα using TTP/PPARα double KO mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether TTP decreases BCAA catabolism through binding and degradation of BCKDC-E2 mRNA. We will first determine whether TTP binds BCKDC-E2 mRNA by performing RNA co-IP and deletion studies on BCKDC-E2 3’-UTR AREs. We will also measure BCAA levels and BCKDC activity in heart tissue from csTTP-KO mice. To demonstrate whether the reduction in BCAA catabolism with TTP KO is through BCKDC-E2, we will perform similar studies with knockdown of TTP and BCKDC-E2. In Aim 3, we will determine whether TTP has detrimental effects on the heart under stress conditions, and whether this depends upon impaired FA and BCAA metabolism.

To determine the role of PPARα and BCKDC in this process, we will use csTTP/PPARα double KO mice and will cross csTTP-KO with protein phosphatase 2Cm KO mice (which have reduced BCKDC activity), and assess cardiac response to stress.

5U54CA268084-03,Northwestern University Center for Chromatin NanoImaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC),"Overall: PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a critical role in fostering tumor resistance to therapies and relapse after treatment. This presents a crucial barrier to the development of successful anti-cancer therapeutics. Transcriptional reprogramming and plasticity play a critical role in and out of the CSC state, which in turn are interdependent on the regulatory function of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin, epigenetic states, and other molecular events. Our understanding of fundamental CSC biology has been hampered by the need for cellular nanoscale imaging technologies that provide both highly detailed structural information regarding 3D chromatin organization and highly multiplexed molecular imaging of the many molecular regulators and events involved in CSC processes. We propose to establish the Northwestern University Center for Chromatin Nanoimaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC) to address this fundamental technology gap in cellular nanoscale imaging and deploy the new technologies to address the fundamental knowledge gap in CSC biology. The Center converges experts in cellular nanoscale imaging, computational imaging, molecular modeling, computational genomics, CSC biology, and oncology. The Center will develop, test, validate, iterate, and deploy an integrated and co-registered Multi-scale Chromatin Nanoimaging Platform that will comprise three “nested-doll” imaging techniques: chromatin scanning transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopic super-resolution nanoscopy, and optical spectroscopic nanosensing. The Nanoimaging Platform will enable quantitative imaging of chromatin structure and highly multiplexed molecular and gene-specific localization, at the most fundamental length-scale approaching 1 nm resolution, including the imaging of statistically significant cell populations and live cells with high temporal resolution over prolonged temporal follow-up times. The Nanoimaging Platform will be bridged to computational genomics, epigenomics, genome mapping, and predictive transcriptional modeling datasets. These technologies will be deployed to answer several long-standing open questions in CSC biology. We will elucidate whether CSCs can originate from non-CSCs via transcriptional reprogramming, test the role of chromatin structure in fostering transcriptional plasticity in CSC processes, and explore the possibility of transcriptionally reprogramming CSCs to exit the stem-state as a new therapeutic strategy. All aspects of the technology development will be guided by the needs of the CSC biology testbed through a series of research feedback loops. In the long term, such single-cell nanoimaging technologies will help comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between structural, physico-chemical, and molecular genomic events. We anticipate that these convergence studies will provide new insights into CSC biology, which are impossible to reveal with the use of any single method, and open new opportunities for identifying therapeutic strategies.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3050,406,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01GM113922-07,Molecular Regulation of Radial Intercalation,"Project Summary: The ability of cells to migrate in a directed manner is critical to a variety of biological processes including morphogenesis, would repair, immunological response and cancer progression. A key feature of migration in an in vivo setting is the ability to break through junctional barriers as a cell migrates across tissue boundaries. This ability requires a distinct set of molecular regulators and requires manipulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. We have developed the migration and radial intercalation of multi-ciliated cells (MCCs) and ionocytes (ICs) in the skin of Xenopus embryos as an experimentally pliable model system for addressing the molecular mechanisms involved as these cells break through the epithelium. Our data indicates that diverse regulators of microtubule (MT) stability have profound effects on the ability of these cells to break through junctional barriers. We have developed the molecular tools and imaging techniques to manipulate, visualize and quantifiably score the ability of MCCs and ICs to migrate towards the apical surface and intercalate into the outer epithelium. We will use these methods to address: (1) Role of microtubules in promoting apical insertion, (2) Molecular and physical regulators of vertex strength. The results from these experiments will provide a detailed molecular mechanism for the complex regulation of MT dynamics during migration and intercalation. While many of these experiments build on migration studies in cell culture, our preliminary data indicates that the in vivo 3 dimensional aspect of our proposed experiments will provide a novel paradigm for understanding this important biological problem. The ability to block cells from traversing junctional barriers could have a significant impact on human health as the ability of metastatic cancers cells to migrate through tissue barriers is a critical step in cancer progression. The unique ability to address the issue of intercalation in distinct cells types will allow us to identify core components of the process. Additionally, the profound reproducibility of intercalation during a discreet developmental window will allow us to identify subtle phenotypes in a quantifiably robust manner that would not be feasible in many other experimental systems.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2292,341,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5K24DC012801-11,Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,"The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2664,369,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01NS084959-10,Genetic Modifiers of Childhood Epilepsy,"Epilepsy is a common neurological that will affect 1 in 26 Americans during their lifetime. Mutations in SCN1A, encoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, are the most common genetic cause of epilepsy. Over 1600 SCN1A mutations have been reported in individuals with epilepsy of varying severity, ranging from mild febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome, a severe infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Dravet syndrome is characterized by a variety of seizure types, developmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variable expressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation, suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by genetic modifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) recapitulate core features of Dravet syndrome phenotypes, including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reduced sodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons, resulting in failure of inhibition and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in the brain. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is strongly dependent on strain background. Scn1a+/- mice on the resistant 129 strain (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrast, Scn1a+/- mice on a [129xB6]F1 strain (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality, with 50% dying by 1 month of age. Strain-dependent differences are also evident at the level of neuron subtypes. GABAergic interneurons isolated from the susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased sodium current density compared to wildtype littermates, while sodium current density is preserved in interneurons isolated from 129.Scn1a+/- relative to wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for the loss of Nav1.1, while F1 interneurons do not. Based on the strain-dependent difference in phenotypes at the whole animal and cellular levels, we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severity due to differences in compensatory capacity among neuronal subtypes in the context of Scn1a heterozygous deletion. We previously mapped several Dravet survival modifier (Dsm) loci that influence premature lethality of Scn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal, we will address our hypothesis in three aims. First, we will perform fine mapping and candidate gene analysis at two Dsm loci on mouse chromosomes 7 and 8. Second, we will perform single cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize differences in cell composition and gene expression in specific cell subpopulations during the critical phase of phenotype onset in epilepsy susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant 129.Scn1a+/- mice. Third, we will evaluate the modifier potential of candidate genes in vivo using transcriptional modulation to up- and down-regulate candidate gene expression. Results from these studies will identify modifier genes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of modifier genes that influence severity of Dravet syndrome will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggest novel therapeutic approaches for improved treatment of human patients.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3252,453,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5R00NS112458-05,A novel blood-CSF adaptive immune response in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder in which neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized to play a critical function. While innate inflammation has been implicated in AD, little is known about the contribution of the adaptive immune response. Preliminary data featured in this application demonstrate a peripheral immune signature of AD characterized by increased numbers of highly-differentiated CD8+ T effector memory CD45RA+ (TEMRA) cells. Strikingly, CD8+ TEMRA cells were also present in patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing indicated their clonal expansion, suggesting antigen specificity of these adaptive immune cells. TCR cloning and peptide screens demonstrated specificity of a subset of clonally expanded AD CSF TCRs to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BZLF1 antigen. These results provide the first evidence of clonal, antigen-experienced T cells patrolling the intrathecal space of brains affected by age-related neurodegeneration. This K99/R00 application will test the novel theory of a detrimental adaptive immune response contributing to AD pathobiology. In Specific Aim 1, AD blood-CSF T cell clonotypes will be related to CSF biomarkers. This approach will determine specific T cell populations in AD and whether these cells relate to disease severity. In Specific Aim 2, antigen identification screens will be used to detect the self/non-self antigen(s) driving T cell clonal expansion in AD. These assays could uncover a novel therapeutic target or biomarker for AD. Specific Aim 3 will determine mechanisms of T cell-mediated neuronal death and resiliency in AD using induced neuronal (iN) cells co-cultured with patient CSF CD8+ T cells. These experiments will assess whether AD CSF CD8+ T cells mount cytotoxic effector responses to iN cells infected with EBV and/or to a molecular mimic of BZLF1. The candidate, Dr. David Gate, has extensive experience in T cell biology and has spent more than a decade studying AD. During the mentoring phase of this award, Dr. Gate aims to advance his knowledge in next-generation sequencing analysis, sophisticated statistical methods, antigen screening, iN culturing methods and CRISPR gene editing. Dr. Gate's mentor and co-mentor, Dr. Tony Wyss-Coray and Dr. Mark Davis, respectively, have comprehensive expertise in these areas. They will provide an enriching environment for Dr. Gate to develop as a prominent independent investigator in neuroimmunology research. As an independent investigator, Dr. Gate will leverage the training under this fellowship to comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate the interactions between T cell molecular components and neurodegeneration.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2707,393,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL161389-03,An ultra-low-input RNase footprinting assay to quantify cytosolic and mitochondrial translation simultaneously,"Ribosome profiling isolates ribosome-protected fragments for sequencing and reveals active translation at the single-nucleotide resolution in vivo. It represents a valuable approach to study various aspects of protein synthesis, such as the regulation of translation efficiency, alternative translation initiation, ribosome elongation and pausing, codon usage, and identifying non-canonical open reading frames and micropeptides (<100 amino acids) encoded in a genome. Thus, it provides unique molecule insights of translational control, which could not be achieved by other genomic technologies, such as mass spectrometry or polysome profiling. However, current ribosome profiling protocols generally use complicated experimental procedures to isolate ribosome-RNA complexes such as though a sucrose cushion, and require millions of input cells. This technical barrier has prevented its application to examing translation profiles of primary physiological tissue samples with low-input cell numbers. To tackle this long-standing challenge, here we propose to develop an ultra-low-input RNase footprinting approach for the rapid quantification of cytosolic and mitochondrial translation simultaneously. Our method simplified the experimental procedure to select ribosome footprints based on optimized RNase digestion. My lab has made the assay work well for as few as 1,000 cultured cells. In this proposal, we aim to further develop the assay and make it work robustly for a small amount of primary tissue samples (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will apply the method to map the RNA translation landscape of rare progenitor cells and differentiated cell types during hematopoiesis (Aim 2). The results will reveal novel mechanisms mediating the translational control underlying hematopoietic cell fate decisions. Finally, by leveraging that our assay provides a simplified method to study mitochondrial translation, we will use it to examine the heterogeneity of mitochondrial translation machinery and build the functional network mediated by individual factors (Aim 3). Altogether, the refined ultra- low-input RNase footprinting method developed in this proposal will be a valuable tool and can be widely used to study the translational regulation underlying complex physiological conditions from normal development to disease progression.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2336,324,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL156792-04,"Immunologic, Inflammatory, and Clinical contributors to HIV-Related Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)","SUMMARY The purpose of this application is to determine clinical, immunologic, and inflammatory factors that lead to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with the clinically relevant goal of improving HFpEF screening, prevention, and therapy for people with HIV (PWH). HFpEF is a complex syndrome with high mortality: 50% of persons with HFpEF die within 5 years of diagnosis. Rates of HFpEF and diastolic dysfunction – the key structural abnormality underlying HFpEF – are significantly higher for PWH than people without HIV, with recent studies finding a 4-8-fold higher prevalence of diastolic dysfunction for PWH than people without HIV. In general, inflammation and immune dysfunction are important precipitants of HFpEF, and may be particularly important for HIV-associated HFpEF. However, data are limited regarding HFpEF clinical risk factors and pathophysiology in PWH. One key reason for this continued scientific gap is that no large, diverse, multi-center cohorts of PWH have adjudicated heart failure events or linked these to biospecimens – a necessary step to accurately characterize and investigate specific subtypes of heart failure. We propose to do this in a large, modern cohort of >35,000 PWH in clinical care throughout the United States; this cohort has an extensive array of individually-linked bio-specimens, patient- reported outcomes, and access to clinical imaging data that are unique among large HIV cohorts and necessary to comprehensively characterize HFpEF in HIV. Our central hypothesis is that PWH with incomplete immune recovery, as indicated by lower CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratios, are especially susceptible to HFpEF in the presence of “second hits” ranging from hypertension to specific ART classes associated with off-target comorbidities (such as weight gain). In the first aim, we will investigate clinical risk factors and interactions thereof which are most strongly associated with incident HFpEF for PWH. In the second aim, we seek to more deeply understand the biology of HIV-associated HFpEF and will therefore leverage a multi-marker proteomics panel – for which we have extensive pilot data in non-HIV HFpEF patients – to define immunologic and inflammatory contributors to HFpEF for PWH. In Aim 3, we will use a novel method to determine, at a single- cell level, meaningful differences in immune cell gene expression that may lead to systemic biomarker abnormalities and HFpEF for PWH; we will validate these findings in cardiac tissue in Aim 4. We have data to support the premise and feasibility of each aim, and our PI is ideally suited to lead the proposed analyses; as a cardiologist, he recently served as writing chair of the American Heart Association's scientific statement on HIV and CVD, a landmark document that required extensive multidisciplinary coordination. Led by the PI, our team has the requisite methods and content expertise to successfully perform the analyses. Through completion of the aims, we intend to generate key clinical and pathophysiological knowledge regarding HIV-associated HF which will inform improved prevention, diagnosis, and ultimately treatment of HFpEF among PWH.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3230,491,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5F31GM149178-02,F31 Microtubule function in the onset of whole-body regeneration,"Project Summary Tissue regeneration is the process of renewal, restoration and growth that allows an organism to re-grow limbs and organs after injury. Tissue regeneration abilities are present in diverse organisms, suggesting they may have been ancient, so the mechanisms controlling regeneration have been important to understand. The freshwater planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea regenerates from nearly any surgical injury, including decapitation, and is a model for understanding the mechanistic basis of animal regeneration. After injury, tissue near wound sites signals to nearby adult pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts, which differentiate to replace all cell types of missing tissue. The highly conserved Wnt signaling pathway is essential for controlling regeneration of anterior-versus-posterior tissue identity in planarian regeneration. The earliest event in head versus tail determination is the injury induced expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitor notum selectively at anterior-facing and not posterior-facing wound sites. However, the mechanism directing this symmetry breaking event is unknown. Injury induced notum expression occurs from the soma of body wall muscle cells possessing longitudinally aligned muscle fibers, suggesting a role of muscle cell orientation and polarity in the onset of regeneration. However, the molecular signals and structure regulating this polarity are unknown, but classic small molecule inhibition studies in planaria suggest a possible role for microtubules in this process. The goal of this project is to uncover the mechanisms by which microtubules participate in the polarity of the regeneration response in the following specific aims. Aim 1 utilizes RNAi to test roles for microtubule regulatory factors expressed in muscle to control injury-induced gene expression at the onset of tissue regeneration. Aim 2 uses epistasis analysis with RNAi to uncover the mechanism by which a kinesin microtubule motor protein relates to a Wnt pathway for head and eye regionalization used in regeneration. These experiments will provide insight on the cellular and molecular mechanism of microtubules during injury induced regeneration. My results will provide new insights into understanding the other factors necessary for proper injury signal and help form a better understanding on what regulates polarity.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2370,338,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R25GM146332-03,ESTELE: Developing The Next Generation Of NGSS Elementary Science Teacher Leaders,"Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) leaders across the country have called for more effective ways to train K-12 teachers in pedagogy aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). While NGSS holds promise as an engaging way for students to build authentic science skills and conceptual knowledge, implementation is limited by the degree to which teachers can be trained in new, significant pedagogical shifts. This is especially true for K-5 teachers who have low confidence teaching science and, accordingly, devote little time to science instruction. This problem is especially acute in urban schools with insufficient resources to meet NGSS training needs. This threatens NGSS coherence across grade levels. We must develop effective, efficient NGSS training models if we are to realize our long-term goal of a well-trained, diverse STEM and healthcare workforce. Prior NIH-funded research from our group developed a highly effective model of introductory-level NGSS training for elementary teachers. The current proposal, ESTELE - Elementary Science TEacher LEaders, builds on this work by accelerating the pace at which elementary teachers can be trained through a new science teacher leader (STL) program. ESTELE fully integrates STL training with introductory-level training via am authentic “practicum” training experience in which STLs support novice teachers as they learn and implement NGSS instructional practices by teaching elementary youth in a summer STEM camp. In this way, teacher leaders gain important leadership and coaching skills, while novice teachers learn NGSS pedagogy. STLs then apply their skills during the academic year in their schools, working in support of their peer teachers to build a broader school culture receptive to NGSS reform. The project’s evaluation plan will assess the degree to which this dual-training model is effective in training teachers of different entering skill levels, the effectiveness of STLs providing NGSS training for novice teachers at their schools, and the degree to which these activities help build a school culture receptive to NGSS instructional practice. This proposal is responsive to key NIH-SEPA priority areas including (1) Adaptations of successful SEPA programs in new locations or with new populations, and (2) Embedded math and reading content for projects targeting P-8 Students. In total ESTELE will train a total of 96 elementary teachers in Chicago Public Schools: thirty-two science teacher leaders and sixty-four new-to-NGSS teachers. It will also support high-quality summer learning for 240 underserved youth at Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago, and high-quality academic year NGSS instruction for up to 7,050 youth in life sciences curricula.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2753,410,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01AG030611-17,LitCog IV: Health Literacy and Cognitive Function Among Older Adults,"We request to continue our NIA cohort study (‘LitCog’; R01AG030611). LitCog studies the confluence of increased medical morbidity resulting in complex patient self-management (SM) roles, and cognitive decline, which may affect older patients’ health literacy (HL) skills and chronic illness self-care. Functionally independent, ‘cognitively normal’ adults ages 55-74 (N=900) were recruited from community primary care practices in Chicago. Participants have completed comprehensive cognitive, psychological, social, behavioral, and functional health assessments every 3 years (4 interviews; 2008-2018). The sample is diverse by race, socioeconomic status and medical morbidity; uncommon among cognitive aging studies. A 1st renewal award (LitCog II) examined changes in cognition, HL and SM skills over 6 years and their associations with physical and mental health. We found cognitive function to be strongly associated with HL; both decline together over time. Cognitive function and HL also determine older adults’ SM skills; all predict functional health status and its decline. A 2nd renewal (LitCog III) has allowed us to capture new health behaviors, chronic disease outcomes, and healthcare use from medical, pharmacy records a decade post-baseline. Cognitive function, HL and SM skills impact all of these outcomes. LitCog III is almost complete; 774 of 900 (86%) subjects are alive and available for further study. We now propose to conduct follow-up assessments 12 and 15 years post-baseline (LitCog IV). With 6 interviews over 15 years, specific trajectories of decline in cognition, HL, SM skills and health status can be closely studied. The prevalence of and adjustment to increasing morbidity, disability, cognitive impairment (including Alzheimer’s Disease & Related Dementias (ADRD)) allow for new outcomes for investigation. Mortality data will also now be available with extended follow-up. Our primary aim is to 1) evaluate trajectories in cognitive function, HL and SM skills over 15 years among older adults, and their associations with health outcomes. LitCog is an exceptionally unique cognitive aging cohort study as it is framed in the context of health services research. Our goal has been to inform health system strategies for effectively managing older patients by understanding how cognition changes and influences HL and SM skills necessary for achieving optimal health. Modifiable factors that may mediate/moderate associations are also explored as potential intervention targets. The involvement and roles of caregivers has specifically emerged as an important social determinant of patients’ health. An administrative ADRD supplement (LitCog IIIA) has expanded our inquiry by including interviews with caregivers (informal or paid) involved in supporting the care of 60% of participants. In LitCog IV, we will create a parallel caregiver cohort, with the secondary aims to 2) investigate associations between the presence of an involved caregiver with treatment adherence, chronic disease outcomes, and functional health status among older adults; 3) identify factors influencing associations between caregiver involvement and patient outcomes.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3180,457,1.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R21AG081627-02,ENhancing exercise with LIGHT to improve functioning in PAD: the ENLIGHTEN PAD Trial,"ENhancing exercise with LIGHT to improve functioning in PAD: the ENLIGHTEN PAD Trial Walking exercise is first line therapy for people disabled by lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, walking exercise does not eliminate disability due to PAD. Even after completing one of our successful exercise interventions that meaningfully improved six-minute walk distance, 82% of 192 PAD participants still reported ischemic leg symptoms after the six-minute walk. Our LITE randomized trial of 305 people with PAD showed that, compared to a control group that did not exercise, home-based walking exercise that induced ischemic leg symptoms (i.e. high intensity) significantly improved six-minute walk, while home- based exercise that did not induce ischemic leg symptoms (i.e. low intensity) had no effect on six-minute walk. Despite greater benefits, ischemic leg symptoms during high intensity exercise reduced exercise adherence. We hypothesize that 670 nm light therapy, administered before home-based walking exercise, will increase minutes of high intensity exercise and enhance the benefits of exercise in PAD. Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with therapeutic properties that improve limb perfusion and reverses the skeletal muscle pathology present in PAD. 670 nm light treatment of the lower extremities increases plasma nitrosothiols, a major source of NO activity. In our preliminary study, 670 nm light treatment of the legs acutely increased lower extremity arterial flow and six-minute walk distance in people with PAD. Therefore, we hypothesize that 670 nm light treatment of the legs immediately before walking exercise sessions will acutely increase nitrosothiols and NO and facilitate greater exercise intensity, thereby enhancing the chronic benefits of exercise in people with PAD. The ENLIGHTEN PAD Trial will collect preliminary data to test whether, in people with PAD, daily 670 nm light treatment of the lower extremities immediately before home-based walking exercise sessions improves six-minute walk distance at 4-month follow-up, compared to sham light. In primary aim #1, we will test whether 670 nm light + home-based exercise increases six-minute walk distance more than sham light + home-based exercise at 4-month follow-up. In primary aim #2, we will measure the acute effect of the first treatment of 670 nm light on six-minute walk distance and on walking intensity (measured with the ActiGraph accelerometer) during the six-minute walk. In secondary and exploratory aims, we will delineate biologic pathways by which 670 nm light enhances the benefits of walking exercise, by measuring the effects of 670 nm light on plasma nitrosothiols, leg perfusion, and gastrocnemius muscle health. If our hypotheses are correct, we will use results of this Phase II Trial to design a definitive clinical trial to test whether 670 nm light, a safe, accessible, and well-tolerated therapy, enhances the benefits of exercise, thereby improving mobility and quality of life in the large and growing number of older people disabled by PAD.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3094,465,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01GM124354-07,Regulation of chromosome segregation during oocyte meiosis,"Project Summary Organisms that reproduce sexually utilize a specialized cell division program called meiosis to reduce their chromosome number by half to generate haploid gametes. Proper execution of this process is crucial for a successful pregnancy, since errors in meiotic chromosome segregation result in aneuploidy (incorrect chromosome number in the embryos), the leading known cause of miscarriages and birth defects in humans. Meiosis in females is especially error prone and this vulnerability has a profound impact on human health: it is estimated that 10-25% of human embryos are chromosomally abnormal, and the vast majority of these defects arise from problems with the female meiotic cells (called oocytes). However, despite the importance of female meiosis for successful reproduction and human health, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that act to ensure accurate chromosome partitioning in oocytes. Oocytes have some special features that necessitate the use of novel cell division mechanisms. Perhaps most significantly, oocytes lack centrosomes, which define and organize the spindle poles in other cell types; therefore, spindles in these cells are morphologically distinct. Using C. elegans as a model, we previously found that acentrosomal oocyte spindles have a surprising organization; chromosomes are ensheathed by microtubule bundles that run along their sides, making lateral contacts, instead of forming end-on kinetochore attachments. Moreover, we also defined new mechanisms that facilitate chromosome congression on these spindles, driven by movement of chromosomes along these lateral bundles. Therefore, our work has revealed a new strategy utilized by C. elegans oocytes for controlling chromosome dynamics during cell division. Building on these discoveries, the goals of the proposed work are to: 1) deepen our understanding of these unique mechanisms, and 2) identify factors that regulate them. An important component of this system is a complex of proteins that form a ring structure around the center of each chromosome pair (the “ring complex”). Our work will therefore delve into the functions of this ring complex, to reveal mechanisms essential for proper acentrosomal spindle organization and chromosome dynamics. These approaches will enable us to gain a mechanistic understanding of oocyte meiosis, an important yet poorly understood form of specialized cell division.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2431,354,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

Failure to translate MVPA programs into care is a result of most interventions being intense, on-site programs that deliver multiple components simultaneously to all participants. This “one-size-fits-all” approach does not account for individual needs, nor can it realistically be implemented into survivorship care. mHealth tools (i.e. smartphone applications, Fitbits, text messages), are inexpensive and have demonstrated efficacy for increasing MVPA in other populations. Thus, they may be a more scalable, less resource-intensive strategy to increase MVPA in more survivors. The ability to integrate wearable MVPA monitor data into the electronic health record (EHR) further enhances the potential for a technology-supported MVPA intervention to be integrated into cancer care. However, responses to these tools is heterogeneous and may vary as part of a gradually progressing (in terms of weekly goal mins) MVPA program. While a minimal intervention including the Fitbit integrated into the EHR (Fitbit+EHR) may be sufficient for some cancer survivors to increase their MVPA, others will need more support. Further, some survivors may need this additional support early on, while others may succeed early, but fail later when the MVPA goal increases. Evidence is lacking to determine: a) whether the best augmentation tactic for non- responders is to offer another mHealth component (i.e. online exercise videos) or a more traditional component (i.e., telephone coaching) and b) when to classify a survivor as a non-responder. Thus, we propose to utilize a novel experimental approach, the SMART (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) to determine the optimal: 1) augmentation component(s) to address non-response and 2) time is to identify non-responders. Breast and endometrial cancer survivors (n=320) will be randomized to early (4 weeks) or delayed (8 weeks) non-response evaluation groups. Those who do not respond to the Fitbit + EHR intervention as evidenced by failure to sufficiently increase their MVPA will be re-randomized to one of two subsequent augmentation tactics, either: (1) online gym or (2) online gym and coaching calls. Responders will continue with the Fitbti+EHR for 6 months. The project is significant because it aims to develop an effective and scalable MVPA intervention for cancer survivors that will move from a one-size-fits-all approached to a dynamic, tailored approach for MVPA promotion by identifying non-responders at the right time and providing them with the additional intervention components necessary to increase MVPA and improve health and disease outcomes.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3119,456,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DK132657-02,Role of FGF23 peptides in chronic kidney disease (CKD),"PROJECT SUMMARY Intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (iFGF23) is a phosphate regulating hormone secreted by bone. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), increased Fgf23 transcription is associated with cardiovascular mortality, disturbed iron metabolism and anemia. Fgf23 transcription is physiologically coupled to FGF23 cleavage by Furin resulting in secretion of iFGF23, carboxy terminal (Cter) and amino terminal (Nter) FGF23 peptides. The well-established function of iFGF23 is to maintain normal phosphate homeostasis by targeting the kidney but there is emerging evidence supporting extra-renal FGF23 targets which might be the result of increased Cter- and Nter-FGF23 signaling. Novel approaches to reduce FGF23-associated adverse outcomes in CKD are desperately needed but current therapies are suboptimal due to lack of understanding of the role of FGF23 peptides. In preliminary data we show that in addition to iFGF23, FGF23 peptides are secreted by bone and extraosseous sources, including erythroid cells, in CKD. We also show that these peptides display novel physiological functions. Cter-FGF23 peptides suppress the secretion of the hepatic iron regulatory hormone, hepcidin, leading to increased circulating iron. Nter-FGF23 peptides are not released in the circulation when FGF23 is expressed in bone, but in iron deficient animals and patients and mice with CKD, FGF23 production by erythroid cells contribute to increased circulating Nter-FGF23 levels. When elevated, Nter-FGF23 reduces the secretion of erythropoietin, inhibits erythropoiesis and induces left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). These observations support important new roles of FGF23 peptides, and a functional role for the coupled regulation of Fgf23 transcription and iFGF23 cleavage. In Aim 1, we will establish the physiological and pathological role of Cter-FGF23 peptides in iron metabolism. Using multiple genetic mouse models, we will delete and overexpress Fgf23 and Cter-Fgf23 in bone, to test whether Cter-FGF23 peptides generated from increased FGF23 cleavage, protect mice against overt hypoferremia by uniquely limiting hepcidin secretion in models of high (inflammation and iron overload) or low (iron deficiency) endogenous hepcidin and compare these effects to exogenous hepcidin administration. We will further test the therapeutic potential of genetic and pharmacologic Cter-FGF23 supplementation in two mouse models of CKD and assess the onset and development of iron deficiency anemia. In Aim 2, we will use the genetic overexpression and pharmacologic administration of FGF23 and Nter-FGF23 in osteocytes and erythroid cells, in vivo and in vitro, to investigate the direct role of iFGF23, Nter-FGF23 and FGFR signaling in the inhibition of erythropoiesis, and their indirect role by regulating erythropoietin (EPO) production in kidney and liver. We will further investigate whether erythroid-produced Nter-FGF23 peptides contribute to LVH in mice with CKD and test the direct hypertrophic effects of Nter-FGF23 in cardiomyocytes cultures. This project will contribute to new insights into the molecular functions of FGF23 and support our ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutic approaches to improve adverse outcomes associated with excess FGF23.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3253,462,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01NS119690-04,Developmental underpinnings of substantia nigra vulnerability,"DA neuron degeneration, resulting in deficient DA signaling, underpins the debilitating motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Among DA neurons, those located in ventral tier of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), are particularly vulnerable, compared to those in the dorsal tier of the SNc or ventral tegmental area (VTA). A mechanistic explanation of selective DA neuron vulnerability remains an important goal, that has been hampered in part by a lack of understanding of the intrinsic differences between DA neurons. We hypothesize that even within a single neuroanatomical cluster like the SNc, there exist DA subtypes with distinct developmental histories and intrinsic properties that may influence their vulnerability. Single cell expression profiling based DA neuron classification from our lab revealed the presence of a key SNc population defined by Sox6 and Aldh1a1 - this subtype was located in the ventral tier of the SNc, and was preferentially vulnerable in a toxin model of PD. Our preliminary data indicate that this population exists in human SNc, and is also selectively vulnerable in post-mortem PD samples. To interrogate the basis for selectively vulnerability in the SNc in depth, we next developed a set of intersectional genetic strategies, which strikingly defined a fault-line in the SNc defined by Sox6 expression, with Sox6+ cells being located ventrally and Sox6- cells forming the dorsal tier. Building on these studies, several key questions remain unanswered. Are dorsal and ventral SNc subtypes developmentally distinct? Do these neurons have different anatomical features and DA release characteristics? Is the size of arborizations of these neurons, a property linked to vulnerability, different? Are calcium fluxes and mitochondrial bioenergetic properties distinct? To answer these questions, in Aim 1, we will determine the origin of SNc neuron subtypes. We will use intersectional, subtractive, and inducible genetic approaches, as well as a novel progenitor anchored fate mapping approach (PRISM) to test the hypothesis that the dorsal and ventral tier DA neurons are developmentally distinguished by Sox6. We will then test the potential of Sox6+ medial vs Sox6- lateral floor plate progenitors to give rise to SNc neurons when transplanted into a PD model. In Aim 2, we will examine the arborization of genetically defined SNc neurons, since this feature has been linked to their vulnerability. Using a new sparse labeling tool, we will plot the projections of genetically defined SNc DA neuron subtypes, and determine the size of their arbors, and explore the molecular determinants of extensive arborization. We will also study DA release from axons and dendrites to determine if dorsal and ventral tier neurons are distinguishable by these criteria, also linked to vulnerability. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that the SNc DA neuron subtypes have distinctive physiological properties and that these differences translate into differences in mitochondrial oxidant stress in somatodendritic and axonal compartments. Overall, our studies redefining the SNc based on lineage will provide important insights into selective vulnerability.",2024,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3198,482,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

These persisting viral populations constitute the principal burden for an effective HIV-1 cure, as they lead to a rapid rebound in viremia when treatment fails or after analytic treatment interruption (ATI). Although persisting viral populations in tissue comprise most of the reservoir, the majority of the reservoir studies do not include tissue samples due to the difficulties to obtain tissue samples containing active foci of replication, the site of the rebounding virus. Therefore, we are not able to properly study these viral populations and their main characteristics remain unknown. Understanding the nature and properties of rebound should bring us a step closer to identifying the reservoir associated with persistence and rapid rebound after ATI. Our previous studies defining the early foci of rebound after ATI revealed an unexpected result as all detected SIV infected cells has a myeloid morphology and stained negative for CD3 and other T cell markers. Those studies were focused on the early reservoir, established when cART is initiated 4 days post challenge. Under these conditions, there are no virus specific cell mediated or humoral immune responses. However, at his point is clear that rebounding virus populations are filtered by immune responses in play when cART was initiated. Based on critical consideration and better model infection in humans, this project will determine the impact of innate and adaptive immune pressure impacts the milieu of the emerging foci in tissues leveraging our PET/CT guided necropsy and resection surgery workflow allowing the study of viral rebound within tissue during the eclipse phase.

5R01ES031809-03,Investigating Environmental Risk Factors for Breast Cancer Using Adductomics,"Despite years of research, few modifiable risk factors for breast cancer have been identified and the incidence of breast cancer remains high with over 260,000 new cases estimated to arise this year. Established risk factors, such as a woman's reproductive history, body size, smoking, and alcohol intake, are estimated to explain only about half of breast cancer cases. In addition, the underlying biological mechanisms linking environmental risk factors and breast cancer are complex and are not well understood. As a result, new approaches are required that can help identify environmental causes of breast cancer. In this proposal, we apply a novel biomarker approach using protein adduct profiles (i.e., adductomics) to investigate associations between environmental exposures and breast cancer risk in the Sister Study. Because the Sister Study is a nationwide prospective cohort that was specifically designed to investigate environmental risk factors for breast cancer, it is an ideal cohort to investigate the hypotheses outlined in this proposal. We will focus specifically on Cys34 adducts of human serum albumin (HSA-Cys34), which is a nuecleophilic “hotspot” on HSA that scavenges reactive electrophiles from circulating blood arising from both exogenous and endogenous sources. We will first use an untargeted adductomics approach in our discovery experiments using high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify new adduct features. We will then employ a complementary targeted adductomics approach with enhanced analytical sensitivity and higher sample throughput to measure adduct profiles in stored plasma samples collected at baseline from 1,800 incident breast cancer cases and a random sample of 1,800 Sister Study participants. Adducts will be compared across groups to identify discordant adducts, and we will use time-to-diagnosis in our regression models to help differentiate between causal and responsive breast cancer biomarkers. Analyses will also be performed to investigate associations specificto breast cancer subtypes defined by ER/PR and HER2 status.Finally, we will perform secondary analyses and investigate associations between HSA-Cys34 adducts and environmental exposures using existing air pollution exposure data. To achieve our study goals, we will integrate methodological and conceptual tools from the fields of exposure science, cancer epidemiology, and cancer biology to forge a transdisciplinary approach for investigating environmental risk factors for breast cancer. This project has the potential for high impact by potentially identifying modifiable risk factors for breast cancer, and identifying underlying biological pathways linking the environment and breast cancer etiology.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2731,386,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

5F31NS126012-02,Dopamine Dependence of Offset Analgesia,"PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain is ubiquitous, costly, and burdensome. Individuals with chronic pain suffer daily—the pain impairs their ability to work, move, and live freely. On a societal level, chronic pain stresses both the healthcare system and the economy. Despite its impact, there is no cure for chronic pain. The inability to properly treat chronic pain has led to the current opioid epidemic. Although we are now beginning to understand the mechanisms underlying chronic pain, we have few ways of assessing and probing these mechanisms. A chronic pain biomarker mechanistically coupled to the circuitry responsible for inducing and maintaining chronic pain would help researchers study and clinicians treat chronic pain. Offset analgesia is a psychophysical phenomenon characterized by a transient, disproportionately large decrease in pain following a slight reduction in noxious stimulus intensity. This phenomenon is both mechanistically and clinically interesting. Mechanistically, it uncouples a noxious stimulus from pain qualia—two often-conflated constructs. Clinically, it is blunted in patients with chronic pain, making it a biomarker for chronic pain. Yet, we do not understand how offset analgesia occurs. By elucidating offset analgesia's mechanisms, we will gain a greater understanding of the nociceptive-pain circuitry. Moreover, it would transmute offset analgesia from a psychophysical correlate of chronic pain to a biomarker that provides neurophysiological insight. This proposal aims to assess the dopamine dependence of offset analgesia. Although we do not know offset analgesia's mechanisms, several lines of evidence suggest it may be dopaminergic. If the dopamine hypothesis holds, then the core mechanisms responsible for chronic pain may also be responsible for mediating offset analgesia. Aim 1 will attempt to generalize offset analgesia to other noxious stimuli since previous work has only tested noxious heat stimuli. We will compare the offset analgesic response and dynamics between hot and cold noxious stimuli. Establishing cold offset analgesia enables us to investigate its broader mechanisms by ensuring our results are not specific to a single modality. Aim 2 will investigate the correlative role of nucleus accumbens in offset analgesia. If the mesolimbic system is responsible for offset analgesia, its dynamics should capture the temporal dissociation between the noxious stimulus (temperature) and pain ratings. Finally, in Aim 3, I will gain experience in a clinical trial led by Dr. Apkarian that uses methylphenidate to perturb dopamine levels. An increase in the offset analgesic response with methylphenidate relative to placebo would indicate dopamine dependence. Understanding the dopamine dependence of offset analgesia is crucial to understanding its underlying mechanisms and its use as a chronic pain biomarker.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2877,417,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5K24HL150235-04,Mentored patient-oriented research of novel mechanisms for cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY Tamara Isakova, MD, MMSc is applying for the K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (POR). She is an Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. She directs the Center for Translational Metabolism and Health within the Institute for Public Health and Medicine and the Clinical and Translational Core of the O'Brien Kidney Core Research Center. Dr. Isakova's research is focused on developing the evidence for novel approaches to improve cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). She has expertise in epidemiologic studies, POR and multi-center clinical trials, and she has served as a scientific mentor for medical students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty. Support from the K24 will provide Dr. Isakova with protected time 1) to devote more time to mentoring a diverse group of young investigators in POR; 2) to improve her POR mentoring skills through mentor training and guidance from senior mentors; 3) to expand into new scientific areas through cross-disciplinary collaborations; 4) to replenish support for her research program through new NIH funding; and 5) to increase involvement in clinical trials, which will allow her to assume leadership in collaborative POR. A large body of evidence implicates disordered mineral metabolism as a mechanistic contributor to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in CKD. The current proposal builds upon this scientific premise and extends the R01-supported work of the PI. Project 1 leverages ongoing work in the CKD Optimal Management with BInders and NicotinamidE (COMBINE) trial, which is a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that tested the hypothesis that nicotinamide (blocks active phosphate transport in the gut) and lanthanum carbonate (phosphate binder) would safely lower serum phosphate and fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) levels compared to placebo over 12 months in 205 patients with CKD stages 3b–4. With support from the K24, the PI will ascertain whether the efficacy of lanthanum carbonate was more pronounced in certain subgroups, determine the relationship of phosphate and FGF23 lowering with myocardial strain, and investigate the effects of interventions on downstream products of nicotinamide and other metabolites and on T50, a calcification biomarker. Project 2 leverages ongoing work in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, which is an observational study of ~4,000 patients with CKD stages 2 – 4. With support from the K24, the PI will determine whether a combined assessment of T50 and other intermediate cardiovascular disease end-points could help identify a CKD-specific cardiovascular disease phenotype, and she will examine possible modifiable determinants of deoxycholic acid, a secondary bile acid implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification in CKD. Conduct of the proposed Aims will advance the field of non-traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, suggest potential therapeutic approaches that the PI will test in future interventional studies and will provide a fertile ground for POR training.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3222,472,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HL152712-03,The identification and pathophysiology of non-infarcted but injured myocardium in the post-ischemic heart,"- In the post-ischemic heart, relatively little is known about the injured-but-not-infarcted myocardium, which we call the intermediate zone as it is neither normal nor infarcted. We recently identified compelling evidence that the intermediate zone is not merely a ""lesser infarct"", but has a set of unique pathological characteristics and contributes significantly to cardiac impairment. These novel discoveries were made possible by overcoming a technological challenge. We developed a high-sensitivity phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)- based imaging technique, enabling the mapping of the intermediate zone which is otherwise missed by conventional methods. Using imaging-guided pathological analyses, we discovered that, in contrast to the infarct zone where there is necrosis across all cell types, in the intermediate zone different cell types survive differently. This disparity between surviving cardiomyocytes (residual contractility) and loss of sympathetic neurons (dysinnervation) creates chaos in electrophysiology. Chronically, the intermediate zone exhibits functional deficiency with signaling activation associated with hypertrophy. The data strongly support that the intermediate zone has significant contractile dysfunction as well as being a substrate for arrhythmias. As such, there are significant prognostic values both for assessing the full scope of myocardial impairment and for predicting the risk for arrhythmias. Based on these findings, we propose a central hypothesis that the intermediate zone constitutes a distinct pathological entity which contributes to cardiac dysfunction in the post-ischemic heart. The hypothesis will be tested in three integrated and synergistic Specific Aims: 1) to refine the in vivo imaging methodology for mapping the intermediate zone, and characterize the pathology of this tissue in an imaging- guided approach; 2) to determine the signaling changes in the intermediate zone; and 3) to investigate the roles of the intermediate zone in arrhythmogenesis. Collectively, the ability to positively identify the intermediate zone in vivo provides a critical technological breakthrough. By understanding the signaling, pathological and functional changes in this tissue, our findings will ultimately have a transformative impact on enriching the knowledge base and shaping clinical practices in ACS.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2356,324,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01NS117104-04,"Interaction between Tissue Factor, Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A, and Integrin B1 to drive self-renewal in glioblastoma","PROJECT SUMMARY Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common cancer arising in the adult brain, and is lethal in nearly all cases. A key contributing factor to poor outcomes for GBM patients is a subpopulation of cells, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), that are highly resistant to routinely used genotoxic/cytotoxic therapies, and ultimately manifest as recurrent tumor. Inhibiting tumor recurrence from CSCs that survive therapy would therefore improve GBM patient outcomes. Our preliminary and recently published work show that CSC survival is dependent on Tissue Factor (TF), a conserved transmembrane and secreted protein involved in blood clotting. TF activates protease- activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a G-protein-coupled receptor on GBM cells, which promotes CSC maintenance and expansion, as indicated by analysis of marker expression, self-renewal capacity, and in vivo growth of CSCs. TF suppression greatly reduces CSC subpopulations, in some cases even leading to complete tumor eradication in vivo. Protective and proliferative effects of TF-PAR2 signaling on CSCs appears to be through activation of multiple classes of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like EGFR, although the mechanism by which TF-PAR2-RTKs stimulate CSCs is unclear. Our preliminary data also show that TF positively correlates with expression of Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A), a protein that promotes cell-cell adhesion by stabilizing integrin β1. CSCs depend on such cell-cell adhesion, and our data show that JAM-A is necessary for CSC behavior in GBM. Because TF can also signal through integrin β1, our overarching hypothesis is that TF upregulates JAM-A expression, which stabilizes integrin β1 and enhances the ability of TF to act on integrin β1 and promote self-renewal in GBM. This has therapeutic relevance, because the pro-CSC effects of TF are independent of its role in hemostasis, and blocking JAM-A could potentially reduce the pro-tumor effects of TF, without causing bleeding that would result from targeting TF directly. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that TF drives JAM-A expression through PAR2-RTK signaling. We will identify components of the TF-PAR2 complex that are essential for TF-PAR2 pro-tumor activities, and will test the ability of TF to trigger JAM-A expression while inhibiting each major downstream pathway of RTK signaling. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether JAM-A requires serpin B3, a serine-protease inhibitor that we have shown binds to JAM-A, for its pro-CSC activities. In Specific Aim 3, we will use molecular knockouts to determine whether JAM-A is an effective therapeutic target against aggressive, high TF-expressing GBM. Completion of this project will advance our understanding of how CSC subpopulations are maintained in GBM, could well be applicable to a wide range of cancers, and would demonstrate a compelling new therapeutic target in treating numerous malignancies, including GBM.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2958,444,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R25MH115855-05,Post-Graduate Research Training Aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan,"Project Summary There is a strong need in psychiatry to invigorate the career development of physician-scientists who can apply advances in neuroscience to applications that improve the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric patients. The need for physician-scientists in psychiatry may be greater than in other fields of medicine, since at present, we still rely almost entirely on the clinical interaction between clinician and patients to obtain the information needed to establish a diagnosis, to select the most appropriate treatment, and to evaluate the effects of that treatment. One day we may be able to apply biomarkers derived from a knowledge of disease mechanisms to assist in establishment of a diagnosis and to select treatment, but even these biomarkers will need to be validated using clinical information collected by physician-scientists, and then integrated with the patient's clinical narrative to arrive at a precise diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan. The proposed R25 program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine (NUFSM) aims to enrich research training for general psychiatry residents and clinical fellows during their usual period of training, so that these individuals maintain and further consolidate their commitment to a career in research that is aligned with the strategic plan of NIMH. We aim to support their training so that they strengthen their commitment to an academic career pathway, where they will acquire critical skills in study design, research methodologies, data analysis, grant writing and career development. Applicants to our post-graduate training programs in psychiatry already demonstrate strong interests and aptitudes for academic careers. Thus, our Northwestern trainees are excellent candidates for an enriched research experience. Also, educational assets currently in place at Northwestern through our CTSA, Physician Scientist Training Programs, Masters of Clinical Investigation program, and various interdepartmental graduate programs can be leveraged to increase the impact of the proposed R25 program.

5K23DA050729-04,Pilot Implementation of Measurement-Based Care in Community Opioid Treatment Programs,"PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose has been recognized as a public health emergency, as lethal drug overdoses have become the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. The gold standard, evidence-based intervention for opioid use disorder is pharmacotherapy, but abstinence rates following pharmacotherapy are sub-optimal. Measurement-based care (MBC), the systematic use of client self-report data to inform and enhance treatment, is an evidence-based intervention that could be uniquely well suited to complement pharmacotherapy for OUD. Unfortunately, very few community opioid treatment programs (OTPs) offer psychosocial interventions to complement pharmacotherapy due to the high volume of patients served and a reliance on group therapy models to accommodate this large census. There is a pressing need for flexible psychosocial intervention structures for use in OTPs that are not associated with typical barriers found in full package, manualized interventions. The training and research activities in this proposal seek to enhance the provision of MBC in community OTPs through two research phases bolstered by four training aims. In Phase 1 of the research plan, the candidate, supported by the experienced mentorship team, will work with 8 OTPs to develop community-engaged research partnerships, complete site visits, and engage treatment providers, leaders, staff, and patients in qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys. Phase 1 outcomes will be used to inform site selection for MBC implementation and to facilitate adaptation of an MBC assessment protocol for use in OTPs. Phase 2 will involve a pilot type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation study with four OTPs. The candidate will work with the OTPs to integrate MBC into electronic medical record documentation procedures. Treatment providers will also receive MBC training and ongoing support, and preliminary MBC effectiveness and implementation data will be collected. To conduct this research, the candidate requires training in four key areas: 1) development and management of community-engaged partnerships to support effectiveness and implementation trials in addiction treatment; 2) training in evidence-based assessment and intervention methods for OUD; 3) training in mixed methods data collection using rapid ethnography; and 4) training in measure design and adaptation. These training aims will be supported by the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies as well as by the candidate’s mentorship team. The mentorship team will be led by Primary Mentor Dr. Sara Becker, an expert in implementation science and community partnership development in substance use treatment settings. The proposal will also be supported by Dr. Francesca Beaudoin, Dr. Lawrence Palinkas, and Dr. Melissa Clark, experts in OUD intervention, rapid mixed methods data collection, and measure design, respectively. Taken together, this research and career development plan will advance a significant public health issue by enhancing the quality of OUD care while launching the independent career of the candidate in the implementation of MBC in OTPs.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3147,455,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
7R37CA225877-05,"Multi-site adaptive trial of a technology-based, EHR-integrated physical activity intervention in breast and endometrial cancer survivors","Increased moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is associated with reductions in treatment- related side effects, cancer recurrence and mortality, and increased QOL in breast and endometrial cancer survivors. However, the majority (~70%) of survivors do not meet cancer-specific MVPA recommendations (i.e., 150 mins/week). MVPA support is not part of standard care, resulting in few survivors having access to efficacious MVPA programs. Failure to translate MVPA programs into care is a result of most interventions being intense, on-site programs that deliver multiple components simultaneously to all participants. This “one- size-fits-all” approach does not account for individual needs, nor can it realistically be implemented into survivorship care. mHealth tools (i.e. smartphone applications, Fitbits, text messages), are inexpensive and have demonstrated efficacy for increasing MVPA in other populations. Thus, they may be a more scalable, less resource-intensive strategy to increase MVPA in more survivors. The ability to integrate wearable MVPA monitor data into the electronic health record (EHR) further enhances the potential for a technology-supported MVPA intervention to be integrated into cancer care. However, responses to these tools are heterogeneous and may vary as part of a gradually progressing (in terms of weekly goal mins) MVPA program and their effects on morbidity indicators is unknown. While a minimal intervention including the Fitbit integrated into the EHR (Fitbit+EHR) may be sufficient for some cancer survivors to increase their MVPA, others will need more support. Further, some survivors may need this additional support early on, while others may succeed early, but fail later when the MVPA goal increases. Evidence is lacking to determine: a) whether the best augmentation tactic for increasing MVPA in non-responders is to offer another mHealth component (i.e. online exercise videos) alone or with a more traditional component (i.e., telephone coaching) and b) what the best adaptive intervention is to improve morbidity indicators. Thus, we propose to utilize a novel adaptive intervention design to determine the optimal: 1) augmentation component(s) to address non-response and 2) adaptive intervention for improving morbidity indicators (i.e., symptom burden and functional performance). Inactive breast and endometrial cancer survivors (n=320) will receive a Fitbit integrated into the EHR (Fitbit+EHR). Those who do not respond to the Fitbit+EHR intervention as evidenced by failure to sufficiently increase their MVPA will be re-randomized to one of two subsequent augmentation tactics, either: (1) online gym or (2) online gym and coaching calls. Responders will continue with the Fitbit+EHR for 6 months. The project is significant because it aims to develop an effective and scalable MVPA intervention for cancer survivors that will move from a one-size-fits-all approach to a dynamic, tailored approach for MVPA promotion by identifying non-responders at the right time and providing them with the additional intervention components necessary to increase MVPA and improve health and disease outcomes.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3174,457,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R01NS126509-01A1,Post-stroke normal appearing white matter diffusion properties and cognitive trajectories across age,"PROJECT SUMMARY Post-stroke cognitive impairment is common, particularly in older individuals. Existing knowledge gaps about mechanisms underpinning poor outcome, particularly in the aged, have been the most significant barriers to developing novel therapeutic targets and approaches to prevent cognitive decline and progression to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). This is especially relevant to health disparity populations, specifically women and Black demographics. Previous studies of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment, suggest that the morphological changes of the corpus callosum are related to cognitive measures. Existing data show that classical neuroimaging biomarkers such as acute infarct volume, location, and white matter hyperintensity burden have modest prognostic predictive utility in models of post-stroke cognitive function. We have recently used diffusion tensor imaging in acute stroke patients to show that decreased fractional anisotropy of the ipsi- and contra-lateral hemispheric normal appearing white matter, as well as the corpus callosum, are associated with higher stroke scale impairment severity. Additionally, we have also used advanced diffusion imaging to examine white matter microstructure in midlife individuals with significant vascular risk factors, as well as Black and women demographics at risk for stroke and cognitive impairment. Our preliminary results suggest that the corpus callosum and other white matter structures involved in cognition manifest specific diffusion changes that not only relate to vascular risk factor burden exposure, but also to post-stroke outcome. Our laboratory has pioneered diffusion MRI acquisition and modeling approaches that are sensitive to not only white matter anisotropy, but also white matter complexity. As such, we are well poised to comprehensively characterize the diffusion properties of normal appearing white matter across time and age, in acute stroke patients and their post-stroke cognitive trajectories. Our established expertise in diffusion imaging and modeling that is sensitive to white matter complexity in relation to the presence of age-related vascular risk profiles, allows us to longitudinally examine the unique microstructural properties of the corpus callosum, infarcted and non-infarcted tissue, and more remote structures on the contralateral non-lesioned hemisphere and their relationship to post- stroke recovery. It is therefore possible that a deeper understanding of white matter microstructure in the acute stage after ischemic stroke and its change over time, will enhance prediction models of post-stroke cognitive recovery and identify novel target for therapeutic interventions. This knowledge will also help our clinicians provide much needed bed-side prognosis to patients and their families. Our central hypothesis is that after unilateral ischemic stroke, temporal changes in the diffusion properties of normal appearing white matter of the corpus callosum specifically, and the white matter across both hemispheres in general, are associated with the differential patterns of post-stroke age-related cognitive trajectories.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3181,438,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01GM140478-03,Development of spectroscopic Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy,"PROJECT SUMMARY One of the major recent scientific breakthroughs was the emergence of super-resolution optical nanoscopy. Nanoscale optical imaging currently plays a crucial role in biomedical sciences and has provided invaluable information about the cellular structure and function at the macromolecular scale. However, the potential of this technology can be immensely enhanced. We propose to develop and optimize a new class of spectroscopic super-resolution imaging tool, referred to as spectroscopic single-molecular localization microscope or sSMLM. It will allow biomedical researchers, for the first time, to achieve multi-color imaging with molecular specificity at sub 10-nm spatial resolution with principally unlimited number of distinguishable molecules. We will develope the sSMLM with modular optical designs and open-source data processing software. The unique spectral analysis optical module will be compatible with existing commercial SMLM systems with minimal or no system modification. The new hardware and software development together with optimized experimental protocols will ensure maximal accessibility of sSMLM by the broad biomedical research community. We anticipate that sSMLM will push the envelope of super-resolution imaging in fundamental biological research beyond current static spatial analysis of only few (<4) molecules.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,1361,185,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5U54CA268084-02,Northwestern University Center for Chromatin NanoImaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC),"Overall: PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a critical role in fostering tumor resistance to therapies and relapse after treatment. This presents a crucial barrier to the development of successful anti-cancer therapeutics. Transcriptional reprogramming and plasticity play a critical role in and out of the CSC state, which in turn are interdependent on the regulatory function of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin, epigenetic states, and other molecular events. Our understanding of fundamental CSC biology has been hampered by the need for cellular nanoscale imaging technologies that provide both highly detailed structural information regarding 3D chromatin organization and highly multiplexed molecular imaging of the many molecular regulators and events involved in CSC processes. We propose to establish the Northwestern University Center for Chromatin Nanoimaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC) to address this fundamental technology gap in cellular nanoscale imaging and deploy the new technologies to address the fundamental knowledge gap in CSC biology. The Center converges experts in cellular nanoscale imaging, computational imaging, molecular modeling, computational genomics, CSC biology, and oncology. The Center will develop, test, validate, iterate, and deploy an integrated and co-registered Multi-scale Chromatin Nanoimaging Platform that will comprise three “nested-doll” imaging techniques: chromatin scanning transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopic super-resolution nanoscopy, and optical spectroscopic nanosensing. The Nanoimaging Platform will enable quantitative imaging of chromatin structure and highly multiplexed molecular and gene-specific localization, at the most fundamental length-scale approaching 1 nm resolution, including the imaging of statistically significant cell populations and live cells with high temporal resolution over prolonged temporal follow-up times. The Nanoimaging Platform will be bridged to computational genomics, epigenomics, genome mapping, and predictive transcriptional modeling datasets. These technologies will be deployed to answer several long-standing open questions in CSC biology. We will elucidate whether CSCs can originate from non-CSCs via transcriptional reprogramming, test the role of chromatin structure in fostering transcriptional plasticity in CSC processes, and explore the possibility of transcriptionally reprogramming CSCs to exit the stem-state as a new therapeutic strategy. All aspects of the technology development will be guided by the needs of the CSC biology testbed through a series of research feedback loops. In the long term, such single-cell nanoimaging technologies will help comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between structural, physico-chemical, and molecular genomic events. We anticipate that these convergence studies will provide new insights into CSC biology, which are impossible to reveal with the use of any single method, and open new opportunities for identifying therapeutic strategies.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3050,406,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HD093718-05,Understanding Diverging Profiles of Academic and Physical Health Outcomes in African American Youth,"PROJECT SUMMARY Across the lifecourse, there are pronounced racial and economic disparities in important life outcomes in America, ranging from educational attainment to incarceration rates to physical health. Nonetheless, a substantial minority of African American youth who grow up under economic hardship achieves positive outcomes, a phenomenon termed resilience. Our research has recently revealed a paradox in the resilience literature. This literature often assumes that if at-risk youth manage to thrive in terms of observable behaviors, such as making it to college, then they have avoided the consequences of adversity. In contrast, we have identified a subgroup of youth who appear resilient on the surface via academic and behavioral indicators, but `under the skin' display signs of compromised physical health, such as higher risk of diabetes and higher scores on allostatic load (a multi-system indicator of chronic disease risk). These findings suggest that the same factors that help youth to succeed academically and psychosocially may be exacting a toll on them physically, resulting in resilience that is only `skin-deep.' Here we propose a project that will clarify why skin- deep resilience develops, when in development it emerges, and whether early-warning signs can be detected. We will recruit 450 African American youth from low-income families ages 14-19. They will be assessed at baseline and 1 and 2 years later, in the context of an accelerated longitudinal design (ALD). The first aim is to identify individual psychological and social network factors that contribute to skin-deep resilience, such as high levels of self-control that may promote academic success but have physiological costs, as well as a lack of belonging or experiences of discrimination with peers in academic environments among skin-deep resilient youth. The second aim is to create biological risk profiles that can function as early warning signs of developing health problems in African American youth. To that end, we will collect in-depth measures of stress hormone output, inflammatory activity, and epigenetic aging over a 2-year period, and test these markers' ability to predict subsequent cardiovascular risk, including metabolic syndrome (primary outcome) and flow- mediated vasodilation (an indicator of endothelial dysfunction; secondary outcome). The third aim is to determine when skin-deep resilience emerges and to characterize its developmental trajectory. To that end, we will use the accelerated longitudinal design to map skin-deep resilience, and its academic, psychosocial, and biological features across the high school and college years. Through this work, we will identify psychosocial targets for intervention, pinpoint optimal development windows for intervention, and highlight biological early warning signs, with the ultimate goal of preventing the emergence of chronic health conditions in low-income minority youth who are otherwise on a track to successful life outcomes.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3008,442,1.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DK131164-02,"Natural history, risk prediction and cost of cirrhosis in insured Americans.","SUMMARY Cirrhosis is a leading cause of mortality in the United States (US), diagnosed in 1.5-9.4 million Americans and results in over 40,000 deaths each year. Every year 5-7% patients with cirrhosis experience life-threatening decompensating events, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), or develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These events often result in hospitalization, disability, or even death. The challenge is to accurately predict those patients who are likely to develop decompensating events and are likely to die. Accurate risk stratification of persons with cirrhosis will allow for early identification and prioritization for guideline recommended care and emerging therapies (e.g., statins). Several predictive models exist but none of them adequately answers this question. Furthermore, no longitudinal cost of care analyses and cost prediction has been performed in the US for persons with cirrhosis. The care of patients with cirrhosis is complex, often involving costly recurrent hospitalizations and procedures. In 2015, the hospital costs alone were reported to be $16.3 billion. Our proposed research will analyze a large national administrative health payer with detailed information on diagnoses, procedures, laboratory tests, medications, in- and outpatient care, as well as standardized costs for insured Americans between 2011 and 2018. Such a large population-based cirrhosis cohort, which includes cost data, offers a unique and unprecedented opportunity to study disease progression, develop highly accurate prediction models, and study costs. Aim 1. To describe the natural history of cirrhosis over time in a large longitudinal cohort of insured Americans with liver cirrhosis in the United States Aim 1.1: Data preparation and variable transformation Aim 1.2: Adjudicate potentially risk-relevant covariates by a cirrhosis stakeholder panel Aim 1.3: Describe the natural history of cirrhosis Aim 2.

5K00CA234799-06,Novel relationships of splicing factors in temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating cancer, due to both our narrow understanding of its molecular drivers and limited therapeutic strategies. One potential mechanistic driver is alternative splicing. The brain contains the most alternatively spliced transcripts of any organ, and many splicing factors are upregulated between normal brain and GBM. While chemotherapeutic options are limited by the physical blood brain barrier (BBB), the DNA- damaging agent temozolomide (TMZ) is able to cross into the brain. However, most patients rapidly become resistant to TMZ and TMZ-resistant GBM is uniformly fatal. An initial goal of my PhD research was to establish novel TMZ-resistant cellular models in order to identify pathways that could be targeted for GBM treatment. My comprehensive characterization of the cell growth, motility, and metabolic phenotypes of my two new TMZ- resistant GBM models forms the basis for my initial first-author paper. During my dissertation research (Aim 1), I have conducted two complementary studies that identify novel approaches to targeting alternative splicing events in GBM. The first (Aim 1.1) is to target the alternatively spliced estrogen-related receptor beta (ERRβ). I have started to define with in silico and in vitro methods how the pro-apoptotic isoform of this gene, ERRβ2, is processed. I found that the serine/arginine (SR) rich splicing factor SRSF6 plays a role in ERRβ2 production and that inhibition of Cdc-like kinases (CLKs, which phosphorylate SR proteins) with TG-003 in combination with the ERRβ synthetic agonist DY-131 potently inhibits TMZ-resistant GBM cells in vitro and in intracranial xenografts. The second (Aim 1.2) is a broader study of splicing inhibition and regulation in TMZ-resistant GBM. I found that TMZ decreases the phosphorylation (p) of SR proteins in TMZ-sensitive, but not TMZ-resistant models. This is accompanied by mis-localization of pSR proteins, and increased baseline levels of DNA damage. In TMZ- resistant GBM cells, the RNA binding protein EWS also mis-localizes and forms aggregates that are stabilized by tubulin. My working hypothesis is that because of the increased DNA damage in TMZ-resistant GBM, the DNA damage response becomes reprogrammed which causes splicing factors (like EWS and pSR proteins) to be displaced from their normal cellular compartments and poised for aberrant aggregation. Also, that this new splicing factor/DNA damage repair axis can be therapeutically targeted with novel splicing inhibitors. During the postdoctoral training period (Aim 2), I will address a key gap in our understanding of the GBM transcriptome: the role of non-coding RNAs, specifically the noncanonical back-spliced or circular RNAs (circRNAs). I propose to define the circRNA landscape of GBM, to determine the regulatory functions and to propose potential therapeutic applications of these abundant and dynamic regulators of splicing and transcription. Together, my pre- and postdoctoral research experiences will have prepared me to balance both big picture ideas and focused studies of mechanism when I establish my own research program as an independent cancer researcher.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3168,472,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F31HL160534-02,Development and Validation of an Observational Rating System for Individual Tailoring in Family-Based Pediatric Obesity Interventions,"Pediatric obesity is a public health crisis associated with costly cardiovascular and chronic diseases and decreased quality of life. A disproportionate number of children with obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI)≥95th percentile for age and gender, are racial/ethnic minorities or socioeconomically disadvantaged. Family-based treatments for childhood obesity have demonstrated effectiveness but struggle with high participant drop-out and inconsistent attendance, limiting opportunities for intervention effects and improving health outcomes. Caregivers frequently drop out due to a program overloading irrelevant information or not meeting their expectations. Due to the complexity of pediatric obesity, contributors to children's weight gain can greatly vary from family to family. Individually tailored family-based programs use rigorous assessment to develop individualized treatment plans that address a family's unique needs and treatment priorities. The Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health) is an assessment-driven individually tailored family-based pediatric obesity program that targets parenting skills and health behaviors and has had high rates of participation and retention among a low-income predominantly ethnic minority sample. Despite the promise of individual tailoring, tools to quantify the process of individual tailoring are understudied, hindering the ability to evaluate individual tailoring and analyze the theory that tailoring affects program engagement and outcomes. The proposed study will develop and validate an observational rating system to measure the process and degree of individual tailoring in family-based pediatric obesity interventions. Videorecorded sessions, transcripts and multimethod data from a completed trial of the FCU4Health, the Raising Healthy Children (RHC) project, will be used to develop the observational rating system. Next, a second trial of the FCU4Health, the Healthy Communities 4 Healthy Students (HC4HS) project, will be used to validate the new rating system. Finally, scores from the new rating system will be used to test the relationship between individual tailoring, program engagement and changes in health behaviors and anthropometric outcomes using a combined RHC and HC4HS sample. This novel research will employ video observation coding, psychometrics, structural equation modeling, and implementation science methods. The new tool will advance the field of pediatric obesity research by providing a rating system to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of pediatric obesity interventions with an individual tailoring component. Quantifying individual tailoring will elucidate its relationship with program engagement and outcomes to inform adaptations for evidence-based interventions. The enhanced interventions will accommodate participants' needs, facilitate health behavior change and ultimately prevent and manage pediatric obesity and reduce risk for associated diseases.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2976,399,1.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1R01ES034753-01,Environmental Pollutants and AHR pathway in Uterine Leiomyoma,"Uterine leiomyomas (LM, fibroids) disrupt uterine function and cause recurrent pregnancy loss, excessive uterine bleeding, and anemia in 15-30% of reproductive-age women. No long-term medical treatment is available. Understanding how a LM develops is essential for identifying new non-surgical treatments. MED12 mutations (mut-MED12) occur in 70% of all LM and drive LM growth in a steroid hormone-dependent manner. Pre- and peri-menopausal women are widely exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), e.g., phthalates, which are found in many consumer products and associated with a number of reproductive diseases. How a mut- MED12 influences LM growth and whether this process is enhanced by exposure to EDCs remain unknown. We recently found that tryptophan (Trp) 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) gene expression is strikingly upregulated in mut- but not wild-type (wt)-MED12 LM. TDO2 catalyzes a critical step in Trp breakdown to kynurenine (Kyn), an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) whose activation stimulates the expression of pro- growth genes to promote cell survival and proliferation in various tissues. Kyn levels are markedly higher in LM vs myometrium, particularly in mut-MED12 LM. Trp and Kyn treatments of LM cells activated AHR and increased cell survival; blocking the Trp-Kyn-AHR pathway by siRNA knockdown or inhibitors of TDO2 or AHR abolished these effects, with mutant LM cells showing higher sensitivity to the treatments. Epidemiological studies have shown positive associations between LM and exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). In vitro, mono(2- ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), a major metabolite of DEHP, stimulated the expression of Trp transporters (LAT1 and LAT2), increased Trp uptake and Kyn production, activated AHR, and promoted LM cell survival. In addition, progesterone receptor is crucial for the expression of AHR and its nuclear translocator ARNT. Thus, the Trp-Kyn-AHR pathway appears to be a hub at which mut-MED12, steroid hormone action, and EDC effects converge enabling LM growth. Our overall hypothesis is that increased Trp uptake and metabolism, Kyn production, and AHR pathway activation, as a result of mut-MED12 or high exposure to the environmental pollutant DEHP, promote cell survival and proliferation and lead to LM growth. Using a xenograft mouse model and genome-wide studies, we will test our hypothesis in the following Aims: (1) Define the functional role of the Trp-Kyn-AHR pathway in LM tumorigenesis. Hypothesis: elevated expression of the TDO2 enzyme in mut- MED12 LM causes Kyn overproduction that activates AHR and promotes proliferation and survival of smooth muscle cells and tumor growth. (2) Determine whether DEHP stimulates LM growth via activation of the Trp- Kyn-AHR pathway. Hypothesis: exposure to DEHP and its metabolite MEHHP upregulates the expression of Trp transporters to increase its uptake, resulting in increased Kyn production and AHR activation leading to LM cell survival and tumor growth. The study will link, for the first time, abnormal amino acid metabolism and LM growth, opening a new avenue for translational research and the development of novel therapeutics for LM.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3209,476,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01NS041280-22,"Resilience, Dysregulation, and Rescue of Basal Ganglia Indirect Pathway Function in Progressive Parkinsonism","Project Summary While the bradykinetic and akinetic symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are clearly linked to the degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic (SN DAergic) neurons1-3, the mechanisms that underlie the emergence and escalation of basal ganglia circuit and motor dysfunction remain poorly defined. Degeneration of SN DAergic neurons long precedes the expression of symptoms in PD4-6. At the point of diagnosis ~50-75% of nigrostriatal DAergic axons and ~30% of SN DAergic neurons no longer express DA cell markers or have been lost7,8, arguing for an extensive prodromal period, masked by compensatory mechanisms9-25. As degeneration proceeds, increasingly dysregulated activity24,26-41 and maladaptive plasticity13-24 within the indirect pathway may progressively degrade basal ganglia computation, leading to motor deficits17,18,26-28,36-40. This circuit pathophysiology has also been suggested as an additional source of bioenergetic stress in SN DAergic neurons that could accelerate their degeneration42-47. Although plausible, these concepts cannot be rigorously studied in acute toxin models that mimic the absence of DA in advanced PD but not the spatiotemporal pattern of DAergic neuron degeneration in patients48,49. To fill this gap, we propose to examine the emergence of parkinsonism and its impact of indirect pathway function in the MitoPark model of PD50. MitoPark mice are generated through genetic deletion of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM in DAergic neurons, which causes mitochondrial dysfunction50-52, a consistent vulnerability of these cells in familial and sporadic forms of PD53-58. These mice recapitulate key aspects of PD, including: 1) progressive SN DAergic neuron degeneration and levodopa-sensitive motor deficits, but within a compressed, experimentally tractable time frame spanning 6- 7 months50,51,59; 2) relative susceptibility of SN DAergic neuron axon terminals in the dorsal striatum in the initial stages of parkinsonism50,52,59-61; 3) relative susceptibility of SN versus ventral tegmental area DAergic neurons50,51,59; 4) circuit plasticity and pathophysiology analogous to that in advanced PD and its models (pilot data). Using in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological, optogenetic, chemogenetic, 2-photon imaging, electrochemical, immunohistochemical, and behavioral approaches, we propose 3 specific aims: 1) determine the mechanisms responsible for the retention of indirect pathway and motor function in prodromal MitoPark mice; 2) determine the mechanisms underlying progressive indirect pathway and motor dysfunction in symptomatic MitoPark mice; 3) determine whether motor dysfunction and degeneration of SN DAergic neurons can be rescued in symptomatic MitoPark mice by chemogenetically manipulating indirect pathway activity. Through the execution of this research, we will learn why aspects of basal ganglia indirect pathway function are initially resilient to but ultimately dysregulated by degeneration of SN DAergic neurons, and whether chemogenetic indirect pathway manipulation is an effective symptomatic and/or disease-modifying therapy for parkinsonism.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,3161,429,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01MH107435-08,"2-Arachidonoylglycerol signaling in anxiety, depression, and stress adaptation","PROJECT SUMMARY Stress is a major risk factor for the development of mood and anxiety disorders and the causative agent in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Development of stress-related psychopathology is variable among individuals and involves complex interactions between susceptibility mechanisms favoring development of psychopathology and resiliency mechanisms protecting against the development of mental illness in the face of adversity. Understanding the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms by which stress exposure is translated into affective pathology could have broad implications for understanding the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders and for the development of novel treatment approaches. We propose to test the overarching hypothesis that the endogenous cannabinoid 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a critical regulator of stress adaptation and propose to elucidate the synaptic and cellular mechanisms by which 2-AG signaling serves to mitigate pathological responses to stress exposure. We will first test the hypothesis that 2-AG signaling inhibits bi-directional excitatory coupling between the amygdala and ventral hippocampus, a neural circuit critical for mediating innate danger avoidance and generalization of learned fear responses. We will test the hypothesis that stress causes a functional collapse of 2-AG signaling within this circuit leading to synaptic strengthening, the generation of increased avoidance, and fear generalization. We will also test the hypothesis that stress exposure leads to increases in 2-AG release within distinct amygdala circuits in a neural activity-dependent manner using a novel virally encoded GPCR-based endocannabinoid biosensor. These studies will reveal, for the first time, the temporal dynamics and activity-dependent mechanisms mediating stress-induced endocannabinoid mobilization within amygdala circuits. Lastly, we will use in vivo single-cell calcium imaging approaches to test the hypothesis that 2-AG is required for the dynamic changes in neuronal ensemble representations to threat predictive cues that occur during fear learning, expression, generalization, and extinction. Taken together, these data will provide new mechanistic insight into how 2-AG signaling regulates stress-related biobehavioral processes relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders including PTSD and could reveal novel pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the translation of stress exposure into affective pathology.",2023,,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,2514,330,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5U01DA036939-09,Multilevel Influences on HIV and Substance Use in a YMSM cohort,"In this competing renewal, we propose to continue the largest cohort study of young men who have sex with men (YMSM) ever conducted. The RADAR study was launched in 2014 to provide critical insights into risk and protective factors for HIV and drug use, and to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of an effective strategy to end the epidemic. RADAR is reflective of the US HIV epidemic; it focuses on the ages with the highest HIV incidence, has exceptional representation of minority HIV disparity groups (38% black, 30% Latino), and is located in Chicago, an urban epicenter of the HIV and drug epidemics (i.e., Cook County was 4th in HIV incidence-2017). During our initial grant period, we were extremely productive in recruitment (N>1,200), retention (>80%), scientific outputs (40+ publications), training future scholars, and serving as a platform for innovative research (25+ connected studies; 7 concepts via NIDA C3PNO consortium). YMSM account for nearly 70% of all new HIV diagnoses among adolescents and young adults each year in the U.S. While all other risk groups have declining incidence, dramatic increases continue among YMSM of color. In an era of evolving prevention and treatment options, YMSM still show insufficient PrEP utilization and fall off the HIV care cascade at high rates. Substance use and minority stressors, with associated social, structural, and biological processes, are key factors that drive disparities. In response to RFA-DA-20-005 we propose a sophisticated multilevel research design, in which we will enhance the cohort in 2020 with 300 new 16-20 year olds and continue to follow existing cohort members. In this renewal, we will answer critical new questions about the HIV and substance use epidemics in YMSM. First (Aim 1), we will keep a pulse on emerging trends in drug use, HIV risk/preventive behaviors, and care continuum engagement. We will chart YMSM developmental trajectories of drug use into adulthood, with a novel focus on how use trajectories and transitions are associated with drug consequences. Further, enrollment of multiple samples of 16-20 year olds (2008, 2011, 2015, 2020) allows us to disentangle historical (e.g., advent of PrEP; marijuana legalization) and developmental changes in substance use, HIV risk and care. Next (Aim 2), we will continue to enroll cohort members’ new serious partners. We will extend our prior work by longitudinally examining the key role that dyadic processes play in the development of substance use problems and HIV risk behaviors and transmission among coupled YMSM. Third (Aim 3), we will build on our provocative findings of high levels of systemic inflammation in the RADAR cohort regardless of HIV status by collecting pathogenic biomarkers of substance use to begin forecasting later-life morbidities for HIV+ and HIV- YMSM. Finally (Aim 4), RADAR will continue to add specimens and data to our well-characterized biobehavioral repository to provide a platform for high-impact science.

5UH3NS114439-03,Investigation of the Cortical Communication (CORTICOM) System,"For many years brain-computer interfaces (BCI's) have been explored as a means of restoring communication to patients with Locked-In Syndrome (LIS), a devastating and often irreversible neurological condition in which cognition is intact but nearly all motor output from the brain is interrupted, effectively cutting off communication with the outside world. To date non-invasive BCI's (e.g. EEG) have had inadequate signal fidelity and spatial resolution, while invasive BCI's using microelectrode arrays in hand motor cortex have delivered cursor and multi-joint robotic control in controlled settings, but have been difficult to learn and have required frequent retraining of decoding models, due to instabilities in the microelectrode-tissue interface. High-density electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings have been recently used by our team (JHU and University of Utrecht) and by others for real-time detection and classification of a variety of different upper limb movements and speech components. ECoG has sufficient spatial-temporal resolution and signal quality to decode the broadband high-gamma (~60-200 Hz) responses of native cortical representations for upper limb movements and speech. Speech representations are spatially distributed over several square centimeters, ideally suited for electrocorticography (ECoG), but impractical for MEA's. In a recent landmark paper in NEJM (Vansteensel et al. 2016) Dr. Ramsey's team in Utrecht demonstrated home use of a fully implantable wireless ECoG BCI by a patient with LIS, without supervision by researchers. To expand on the capabilities of this 4-channel system, our team proposes a first-in-human clinical trial to establish the safety and efficacy of an ECoG BCI with far more channels, implanted for 6 months. Based on the long-term safety and signal quality of ECoG demonstrated in neuromodulation for epilepsy (Neuropace RNS), we have an IDE for the proposed “CortiCom System”, which uniquely combines a 128-channel HD- ECoG array (PMT Corp) with a transcutaneous pedestal connector and neural signal processor (Blackrock Microsystems). In this early feasibility trial, our team will pursue the following Aims/Milestones: 1. Demonstrate efficient and stable control of essential BCI functions (initiate BCI, call caregiver, and BCI menu navigation). CortiCom will use real-time decoding of attempted movements of different fingers, arm joints, and mouth and face muscles to control the critical BCI functions, e.g. caregiver calling (by 3 months), and menu navigation--Up/Down/Left/Right, Enter, and Back/Escape (6 commands). 2. Demonstrate efficient and stable operation of a keyword-based speech BCI. CortiCom will use low- latency detection and classification of attempted speech (keywords) to expand communication. Keyword decoding will use a hierarchical hybrid model to detect and classify keywords based on their unique spatial- temporal signatures of population activity. Keyword command vocabulary, based on communication value and ease of classification, will expand from 6 (by 3 months) to 20 or more keywords during the trial.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3107,444,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

Cellular membrane proteins acting as a drug efflux pump have been identified, and while some promising agents enter tumor cells, they cannot always be retained long enough to be effective.

This enzyme-driven self-assembly serves several purposes: 1) intracellular entrapment with minimal drug efflux; 2) prolonged tumor drug exposure; and 3) minimal toxicity to normal organs due to rapid blood clearance of non-assembled single molecules. We have preliminary data demonstrating this concept to be feasible in vivo. Since it does not only serve as an anti-cancer drug through inhibition of DNA methylation, but also as a non-metallic, label-free contrast agent for chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST MRI), olsalazine is a unique theranostic agent. The drug can be visualized without modification, allowing direct imaging without pharmacological alterations that may affect self-assembly and/or biodistribution. Following in vitro selection of an optimal Olsa-CBT-800CW-Rn- AAN substrate with maximum tumor cell penetration and retention in legumain-overexpressing DU145 cells (Aim 1), we will test this compound for its in vivo nanotheranostic properties in an orthotopic mouse prostate tumor model (Aim 2) and a transgenic mouse model (TRAMP mouse) where normal prostate cells undergo a malignant transformation over time (Aim 3). If successful, this approach may be extended to other enzyme- targeted CEST MRI-detectable theranostic platforms for imaging tumor aggressiveness, drug accumulation, and predicting therapeutic response.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2178,303,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DA050470-04,"A geospatial analysis of hotspots and targeted injection settings pilot intervention for HIV prevention among people who inject drugs in Baltimore, Maryland","Project Summary This resubmission of application R01DA050470 proposes to use innovative approaches to identify “hotspots,” defined as geographic areas in which high rates of HIV or HCV infection, high HIV viral loads, or drug-resistant HIV strains are found. We propose two novel approaches for identifying hotspots: 1) Use of web-based mapping technology to document observed and self-reported HIV and overdose risk behaviors among PWID in private and semi-public injection settings (SPIS) and the attributes of these risk settings; 2) Systematically collect cookers (containers used to mix and heat drugs before injecting) from injection settings and test them for HIV and HCV antibodies (testing cookers is a novel method developed in the Johns Hopkins Virology lab). We will recruit 600 HIV positive and negative people who inject drugs (PWID). These PWID will complete a survey using a software program developed by our team to locate and map the areas where they inject and attributes of these injection settings. These data will be used to identify high-risk behaviors in SPIS within census block groups (CBGs). These participants will be followed for 2 years. The findings from this observational portion of the study will then be used to inform an innovative pilot of an injection setting targeted peer-driven intervention to reduce HIV/HCV transmission and overdose risk behaviors. From the identified CBGs, we will select 60 non-contiguous CBGs for a pilot cluster randomized trial (CRT) of the intervention. The CBGs will be randomized to one of 4 conditions: 1) Peer education and stocking of SPIS with risk reduction materials, 2) Peer education only, 3) Stocking SPIS with risk reduction materials only, and 4) The standard of care. Based on their CBG and SPIS use, 120 index PWID participants will be selected from the 600 PWID. These index participants will receive training corresponding to the assigned condition of their CBG. The indexes will implement the intervention targeting two specific SPIS. Each index will also recruit PWID from their CBG to serve as data collectors. In the SPIS, the data collectors will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and collect cookers for HIV/HCV testing. Data from the indexes (N=120) and data collectors (N=120) will be used as outcomes of the 4-arm intervention.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2327,365,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5U01NS115587-04,Neuropixels NXT: Integrated Silicon Probes for Large Scale Extracellular Recording in Rodents and Primates,"1 Project Summary: The BRAIN 2025 Report, with the goal to “produce a dynamic picture of the functioning brain 2 by developing and applying improved methods for large-scale monitoring of neural activity” is directly 3 addressed by this application. The Neuropixels probe (Jun et al., Nature 2017) demonstrated that a high 4 channel count Si shank with continuous, dense, programmable sites yielded a large capacity increase in 5 monitoring of neural activity (100's vs. 10's of units for typical devices). Neuropixels NXT will increase 6 substantially the utility of that high capacity shank by optimizing and deploying a new platform technology for 7 neural recording, direct-to-digital. Neuropixels, while revolutionary over prior art, has an integrated probe 8 “base” for amplification and digitization and a digital interface board (head stage) that both reside above the 9 brain. Together, the crowding of these components above the brain limits the number of shanks that can be 10 used in one experimental animal. Follow-on projects are already underway to relieve this crowding and weight 11 such that we expect 2 Neuropixels probes (768 channels of recording capacity) could be used on a freely 12 moving, tethered mouse. While this represents a substantial improvement, it remains far short of the brain wide 13 recording that satisfies the above stated ambition to “produce a dynamic picture of the functioning brain”. 14 Building on the demonstrated performance of the Neuropixels shank, we propose to optimize the base 15 electronics so that a probe with ~768 channels would have a base of < 5mm2 (an 18x shrinkage of the base 16 area per channel compared to Neuropixels, and 6x shrinkage compared to Neuropixels 2.0), require no extra 17 digital interface board (head stage), and instead have a 6-conductor micro-cable between the probe and a high 18 speed data hub for digital transmission that can handle multiple probes simultaneously. This smaller probe 19 base will allow it to be made narrow so that each probe will act as a “unit shank” that can be tiled side-to-side 20 into a “comb”, and combs stacked into 2 dimensional arrays of shanks, yielding dense 3 dimensional arrays of 21 programmable recording sites. We project capacities of >16 shanks (9600 sites/channels, all active) in a 22 mouse, 40 shanks (40,000+ programmable sites, 26,000+ channels) in a rat, and up to 100 shanks (450,000 23 programmable sites, 76.800 channels) in a non-human primate. The work plan will first optimize: 1) the design 24 of the direct-to-digital recording channel pixel for size/noise tradeoff, and 2) the data hub to allow up to 12 25 probes to be served by a single output cable. With this information, a family of “unit shanks” will be produced, 26 ready for sale to the research community, which can be fixtured into a wide variety of recording geometries. 27 These developments in an environment capable of long term manufacture and affordable costs will ensure 28 wide availability.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2998,487,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R24ES030893-05,Expanding the Value of the EARLI study: Small Cohort with Big Data,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including ASD, affect over 15 percent of US children – Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) alone affects approximately 1.5% of US children. Identification of underlying causes can lead to primary and secondary prevention efforts. Substantial evidence supports contribution of both genes and environment, particularly prenatal exposures. Prospective studies, with exposure information collected during pregnancy, prior to symptom onset, are sorely needed although prospective studies in the general population are not feasible, cost effective, or efficient for ASD. The enriched-familial-risk design, which capitalizes on the substantial recurrence risk of both ASD and NDD among siblings of children with ASD, has been employed to achieve prospective data collection with reasonable outcome events. The Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) study has helped to trailblaze this enriched risk cohort approach. EARLI recruited and followed over 260 pregnant women who already had a child with ASD with multiple study visits, child assessments, biosampling, and home environment surveys over pregnancy and the first 3 years of life. While the total sample size was constrained; the value of EARLI is the depth of longitudinal data and molecular measurements across multiple tissue types and early developmental windows. To date, over 9.4 billion data points have been generated across multiple phenotypes, tissues, exposures, and -omic measures. The current proposal seeks to maintain and enrich this valuable study to fully realize its impact on environmental health. The goals are to: 1. Maintain and extend the EARLI Biosample Repository through support of the storage and retrieval efforts and addition and storage of shed baby teeth that will enable longitudinal prenatal exposure measures across a growing array of toxicant exposures. 2. Measure frequency and patterns of emerging co-occurring conditions at school age to better characterize phenotypes across co-occurring NDDs and quantitative traits. 3. Characterize variability of heavy metals measurement across timing, family members, and matrices including maternal blood and urine and shed baby teeth. 4. Develop and apply methods for phenotype and for exposure harmonization using latent constructs, enabling within and cross- cohort investigations; 5. Migrate, enhance, and increase the reproducibility of EARLI research data to enable data sharing. The EARLI study is a valuable asset to early life environmental epidemiology of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Conducting these aims will allow us to maximize the contribution of this novel study to the understanding of ASD and NDD etiology.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2697,387,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F32CA271470-02,Structural modeling of neoantigen presentation for rational design of heteroclitic neoepitope vaccines,"Project Summary Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) is highly resistant to frontline surgical resection and chemotherapy treatments. Many treatment-resistant cancer types have benefited from immunotherapies that activate cytotoxic anti-tumor T cells against the somatic mutations, or neoantigens, expressed in cancer cells. One major challenge to the development of neoantigen-targeted immunotherapy for PDAC has been the low number and weakly immunogenic profile of identified neoantigens. Efficient activation of neoantigen-specific T cells is dependent on the recognition of 8- to 11-mer neoepitopes displayed on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules. This recognition is the culmination of the biophysical and stereochemical contacts between the peptide, HLA, and T cell receptor (TCR) molecules. One mechanism to improve neoepitope immunogenicity is by modifying the peptide amino acid residues to enhance HLA binding or TCR recognition, thereby enhancing cognate T cell activation, while conserving reactivity to the parental epitope. These modified epitopes are termed heteroclitic epitopes. However, the stereochemical features of heteroclitic epitopes that enhance HLA binding or TCR recognition are understudied. Additionally, heteroclitic epitopes have been explored in the context of a limited number of HLA subtypes, restricting their development and application across patients. We hypothesize that rational design of heteroclitic neoepitope vaccines through structural modelling will improve T cell responses against PDAC neoantigens. To address this hypothesis, we will define the structural binding and spatial display dynamics of both shared and private PDAC heteroclitic neoepitopes in diverse HLAs. Among shared neoantigens expressed in PDAC, activating mutations in KRAS at codon 12 are present in up to 80% of PDAC tumors. In Specific Aim 1, we will interrogate the structural mechanics and immunogenic profile of heteroclitic KRAS G12D/V/C epitopes in a panel of 18, globally representative HLA subtypes. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop a computational pipeline to identify, prioritize and optimize patient- specific heteroclitic neoantigen vaccine candidates based on structural epitope features. We will use HLA binding measurements and T cell reactivity assays to validate immunogenic features of our computationally modelled heteroclitic epitopes. Together, these aims will define the structural features of immunogenic neoantigens in diverse HLAs, generate heteroclitic epitope vaccine candidates for shared and private PDAC antigens, and improve the therapeutic potential of cancer vaccines for hard-to-treat cancers such as PDAC.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2683,370,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01EB028259-04,Multi-voxel spectral editing at 3T,"PROJECT SUMMARY Edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows the non-invasive detection of low-concentration metabolites within the brain, free from overlap from other, more abundant compounds. Until recently, spectral- editing techniques have generally focused on measuring individual metabolites in one brain region at a time (for instance, the well-known ‘MEGA-PRESS’ method). However, this is a time-consuming approach which severely limits clinical applicability when multiple metabolites and/or brain regions are involved. The main goal of this proposal is therefore to develop and establish the reproducibility edited experiments that can detect multiple edited molecules in multiple brain regions, all within a single acquisition. We will develop multi-voxel localization techniques to combine with our recently developed multi-metabolite editing methods, including the Hadamard-encoded ‘HERMES’ approach as well as the new ‘HERCULES’ method which allows for up to 13 metabolites to be simultaneously determined. For applications that may require a limited number of voxels to be acquired, we will developed multi-band excitation and parallel acquisition ‘PRIAM’ methods in combination with HERMES and HERCULES. For applications that require greater spatial coverage and/or the ability to map out the spatial distribution of metabolite levels, edited MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) techniques will be developed for use in combination with HERMES and HERCULES editing. Since edited-MRSI is very sensitive to head motion and other instabilities, acquisition and processing methods will be implemented for robust, motion-insensitive edited-MRSI. Rigor and reproducibility will be carefully assessed; newly developed methodologies will be validated by comparison to conventional measurements in the same subjects. Expected improvements in temporal signal- to-noise ratios and reproducibility will also be measured. The resulting data acquisition and analysis tools will be made available for dissemination to the clinical neuroscience and neuroimaging communities.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2070,280,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

Conducting studies in the most affected areas of the world is critical to the international HIV research agenda. The Johns Hopkins University-Blantyre, Malawi Clinical Trials Unit (JHU Blantyre-CTU) and its clinical research site (CRS) in Malawi, located in one of the most affected regions of the world, propose to continue and expand high- impact research collaborations with four NIAID Clinical Research Networks in order to prevent, treat, manage and potentially cure HIV and AIDS in adults, key populations, and children. With more than 30 years of HIV research experience and the strong backing of the host institutions (Johns Hopkins University and College of Medicine, University of Malawi), the CTU and CRS leadership will be responsible for the conduct and management of clinical trials at the Blantyre, CRS in accordance with the Research Networks and NIAID policies. The CTU aims to advance the scientific agenda of the proposed Clinical Research Networks for HIV prevention, treatment and vaccine research among adults and children by generating hypotheses and developing new scientific concepts; continuing implementation of active study protocols at the Blantyre CRS under the current CTU; making available the efficient and flexible local research infrastructure to quickly respond to emerging needs of the Networks; and by engaging protocol-specific populations. The CTU will emphasize quality, oversight, cohesiveness and efficiency in all operations as it works to achieve these aims. During the current CTU cycle (2013 to present), the Blantyre CRS has been involved in 35 studies at various stages, from initiation to completion, for four existing Division of AIDS/NIAID Clinical Research Networks. The CRS has established effective institutional and community collaborations and has been responsive to both the Network agendas and the national health research agenda for Malawi.

5R35NS097966-08,De novo Synthesis and Memory,"Project Summary Memory is our most precious possession, yet we remain unable to prevent its loss in neurological diseases. Here we examine a fundamental property of memory, which is its dependence on rapid de novo protein synthesis, and identify pathways that contribute to normal memory and that underlie human memory loss. Dr. Worley's laboratory pioneered the discovery and analysis of cellular immediate early genes (IEGs) as effectors of protein synthesis-dependent memory, and has described mechanisms mediated by IEGs Arc, Homer 1a and NPTX2 at excitatory synapses that strengthen active synapses and weaken inactive synapses. Emerging concepts integrate their individual molecular and synaptic functions into a temporal program of sequential cellular and circuit adaptations that encode information. The process begins with Arc and Homer1a, which act cell-autonomously to control the synaptic expression of AMPA type glutamate receptors. A later process mediated by secreted NPTX2 acts non cell-autonomously to strengthen excitatory synapses on a specific class of inhibitory neurons that express parvalbumin. Studies from mouse models indicate that down regulation of NPTX2 results in increased neural activity that may occlude the ability of networks to encode information, as well as a propensity for activity-dependent pathology including seizures and Aß amyloid generation. Remarkably, aspects of this inhibitory network phase of information storage can be monitored in living human subjects. Secreted NPTX2 is detected in human CSF and is prominently down-regulated in neurological diseases in association with cognitive deterioration. We hypothesize that NPTX2 down-regulation provides a rational biomarker of cognitive status in human neurological disease and may be is causal for certain memory deficits. Basic studies will examine the unusual regulatory mechanisms that control NPTX2 expression and function, and identify processes that result in its down-regulation in human brain. We will also gain deeper insight into how IEGs, and NPTX2 in particular, contribute to memory using gain and loss of function approaches in in vivo models of activity-dependent network plasticity including hippocampal replay. Stable, long-term support will allow us to establish a multidisciplinary research program that leverages the strengths of the Neuroscience community at Johns Hopkins for basic studies, and the Clinical Departments of Neuropathology and Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins and Neurology at UC San Diego for translational aspects of disease research.

5R21HL161685-02,Computational simulation of the potential improvement in clinical outcomes of cardiovascular diseases with the use of a personalized predictive medicine approach,"Project summary Under the current clinical paradigm, the majority of patients sharing a pathology tend to be treated in a similar manner according to clinical guidelines that are based on previously conducted clinical trials combined into meta- analyses. While some situations are amendable to the stratification of care, that is using more or less intensive therapy based on the presence of specific risk factors, true personalization of care (i.e. therapeutic or management selected based on a comprehensive review of patient characteristics and possibly including patient-specific prediction models) remains exceedingly rare despite the potential for improved patient-level outcomes. One important question in this regard that has not yet been answered is the extent to which a personalized approach would result in clinical benefits should it be used in a large number of patients. At this time, given the paucity of examples of large scale implementation of personalized care, it is not possible to directly provide an answer; however, we could use existing data to generate a reliable approximation through computer simulations. Thus, we propose to use data from ~130 previously published NHLBI funded randomized clinical trials to simulate the effect of personalized medicine and compare the group-level outcomes to results expected in the same patient population without using a personalized approach to treatment choice. Specifically, for each clinical trial included in this study, we will create arm-specific prediction models for the primary outcome and apply it to the opposite study group, thus estimating the theoretical, patient-specific probability of achieving the primary outcome had they been assigned to the opposite trial arm. Simulations will then be performed separately for all trials where patients are respectively assigned to: 1) the treatment arm of the trial, 2) the control arm of the trial or 3) to whatever arm carries the lowest probability of adverse outcomes (i.e. predictive allocation). We will then calculate the net benefit of predictive allocation by comparing the cumulative prevalence of outcomes in that simulation vs. either the simulation where all patients are assigned to either the treatment arm (for positive trials) or where all patients are assigned to the control arm (for negative trials). Finally, we will compile the data from all included trials and identify factors that are associated with changes in the net benefit of predictive allocation, including both trial-specific risk factors and performance metrics of the prediction model used for patient allocation. This study will allow us, for the first time, to estimate the potential improvement, at the population level, that would be associated with the widespread utilization of a personalized approach to treatment choice. We will also generate crucial information in regards to the clinical scenarios and situations where such an approach would generate the highest benefits.

5U01AI168287-02,Solving Opportunities for Spillover (SOS): Frequency and Mechanisms of Cross-species Transmission of Henipaviruses in Bangladesh,"Until and unless we better understand and prevent spillovers of bat-borne viruses into intermediate hosts and humans, we will be severely limited in our ability to stop pandemics. Henipaviruses are bat-borne, RNA viruses that spillover through this route. Nearly half of all reported human henipavirus infections have been associated with contact with sick domesticated animals, though our understanding of drivers of henipavirus spillovers and specific transmission pathways remains severely limited. Building on preliminary data about bat, domesticated animal and human infections, this multidisciplinary study integrates epidemiology, ecology, and anthropology to identify spillover pathways for henipaviruses into domesticated animals in Bangladesh and the risk they pose to human health. Our first aim is to identify drivers of henipavirus spillovers into domesticated animals in Faridpur, Bangladesh. We will use multiplex pan-henipavirus assays to identify infections in Pteropus medius bats and domesticated animals living nearby this roost through cross-sectional and prospective studies. Combined with intensive studies of bat-domesticated animal interactions and weather data, we will build statistical models to identify the relative contribution of each of these factors. Our second aim is to describe which henipaviruses are being transmitted from bats to domesticated animals. Serologic studies of animals in Bangladesh show that they are frequently infected with non-Nipah henipaviruses. Through surveillance for and sampling of sick domesticated animals, we will describe the specific viruses that spillover from bats in Faridpur. Our third aim is to determine the risk of henipavirus transmission from domesticated animals to humans. We hypothesize that undetected henipavirus spillovers in humans are occurring through contact with sick domesticated animals and will conduct cross-sectional and prospective serosurveys of humans who have close contact with sick animals in Faridpur. We remain ignorant about henipavirus spillovers through intermediate hosts – including the specific viruses spilling over, the frequency and distribution of spillovers, and the pathways of transmission – at our own peril. The knowledge gained from this study will be immediately applicable to human and animal health programs in Bangladesh and other countries where henipaviruses circulate in bats. By learning about which henipaviruses infect humans, and how they are infected, we can advise public health surveillance programs on how to optimize detection and epidemiologic investigation of cases across Bangladesh. Our investigations about spillovers in Faridpur can also be scaled- up to other areas of Bangladesh and countries where henipaviruses circulate in bats so that we can truly begin to appreciate the scale of henipavirus spillovers in the global landscape.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2873,406,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01EY030883-05,Targeting aging genes and pathways to promote optic nerve regeneration,"Summary To date, targeting the genes regulating intrinsic axon growth ability have produced by far the most promising results in optic nerve regeneration. Recent studies, including ours, have provided strong evidence that neuronal aging might be a key converging process underlying the loss of intrinsic axon growth ability of CNS neurons. Indeed, many genes that act to regulate axon regeneration are also hallmark genes of aging (genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alteration, and nutrient sensing, etc.). First, recent studies and our preliminary results showed that c-Myc and p53, two well-known genes involved in DNA repair and genomic instability during aging, act to support optic nerve regeneration. Second, our preliminary study showed that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) was necessary for sensory axon regeneration in vivo. Third, aging is often associated with decreased methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) and increased methylation of H3K4, resulting in reduced amount of heterochromatin. In support, the level of H3K27 demethylase UTX increases during aging and knocking out UTX in c. elegans promotes longevity. Our unpublished study showed that knocking out UTX and its targeted gene, Magi3, in RGCs drastically promoted optic nerve regeneration. Fourth, the insulin and IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathways, the key regulators of nutrient sensing, are the most conserved aging controlling pathway in evolution. IGF-1 and many IIS downstream targets, such as Pten/PI3K, Akt, and mTor, are all important regulators of optic nerve regeneration. Our published study and a recent study have shown that Sirt1 and LKB1, two important nutrient sensors, function to regulate sensory axon and spinal cord regeneration, respectively. Foxo3, another key target of Akt signaling, has recently been shown to promote vascular cell regeneration through Sirt1. Lastly, recent findings indicated that cellular reprogramming process can reverse aging and rejuvenate the cells. Importantly, manipulations of several reprogramming factors, such as KLF4 and Lin28, have been shown to promote optic nerve regeneration. Therefore, we hypothesize that aging regulatory genes/pathways can be manipulated to promote optic nerve regeneration through rejuvenation of mature CNS neurons. In Aim 1, we will determine if manipulation of miR-138/Sirt1, TERT, and Foxo3 in RGCs can promote optic nerve regeneration. In Aim 2, we will first determine if combination of these aging genes with myosin II knockout or enhanced neural activity would have synergistic effects on regeneration. We will then use RNA-seq and ATAC-seq of purified RGCs to explore how these aging genes regulate optic nerve regeneration. In Aim 3, by performing RNA-seq and ATAC-seq of purified RGCs at different developing, maturation, and aging stages, we will first use advanced integrative bioinformatics analyses to identify top candidate aging genes and their associated transcription factors, both of which act to orchestrate RGCs aging. We will then perform functional screening experiments to determine their roles in regulation of axon growth and optic nerve regeneration.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3165,465,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01HD100485-05,Inflammatory mechanisms responsible for the development of multiple organ dysfunction in pediatric patients following allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (BMT).,"Allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) is the only curative therapy for many pediatric patients with malignant and non-malignant disorders. Unfortunately, treatment-related complications remain a major barrier to successful outcomes. A multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) workshop convened by the NICHD in March 2015 identified respiratory failure, the delivery of cytotoxic therapies and complications associated with allo-BMT as three distinct contributors to MODS and death in pediatric patients. The significance of respiratory failure occurring after BMT was recently underscored by a June 2018 NIH workshop specifically convened to identify clinical challenges and scientific knowledge gaps regarding pulmonary dysfunction after BMT in pediatric patients. Hence, the development of novel strategies that reduce the incidence and severity of pulmonary dysfunction after allo-BMT remains a significant unmet need. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a frequently fatal form of lung injury occurring after BMT. Progress has been made to understand the mechanisms responsible for IPS; the Cooke lab discovered that TNFα contributes directly to vascular endothelial cell (EC) injury and regulates the subsequent influx of donor cells into the lung. These insights lead to several clinical trials testing the effects of etanercept (a dimeric TNFα binding protein) in BMT-recipients with IPS. While successful, not all patients respond to etanercept revealing a critical need for continued research. Proteomic evaluation of plasma sample revealed striking similarities between human and experimental IPS and identified protein candidates that associate with EC injury and disease onset. Additional studies revealed a here-to-fore unknown association between IPS and the protein angiopoietin (Ang)-2. Ang-1 and Ang-2 are peptide ligands for the receptor tyrosine kinase, Tie-2 and represent an agonist / antagonist pair that regulate EC integrity. Moreover, Ang-2 sensitizes ECs to TNFα and regulates TNFα-induced adhesion molecule expression. Hence a significant body of pre-clinical and clinical data provides the basis for the following central hypothesis: During inflammation early after allo-BMT, the Ang1:Ang2 pathways regulate cytokine-mediated EC activation and integrity, increased adhesion molecule expression, and development of IPS. Pertinent to this application, EC damage and dysfunction is a common-thread among several BMT-related complications including IPS, graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver all of which contribute to MODS after BMT.

The translational research potential of this application is therefore significant: Proposed experiments will enhance our understanding of how inflammation after transplant contributes to vascular EC injury and organ dysfunction with great potential to reduce the risk and severity of MODS in pediatric BMT recipients and thereby improve outcomes and broaden the utility of this powerful form of cellular therapy to children in need.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3228,451,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01CA238284-05,Genetic and genomic determinants of homologous recombination repair deficiency as treatment selection markers for lethal prostate cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRD), particularly from biallelic mutational loss of BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM (BRCA/ATM), is significantly enriched in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Such patients have multiple FDA-approved systemic life-prolonging therapies to choose from, including abiraterone, enzalutamide, and taxane chemotherapies, as well as the possibility of poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy which currently remains investigational. A few recent studies suggest that patients with germline and/or somatic HRD mutations may respond better (and for longer durations of time) to novel hormonal therapies than their HRD-negative counterparts. These studies suggest that in addition to PARP inhibition, potent AR suppression is also “synthetic lethal” with HRD in mCRPC. However, the genetic/genomic determinants of HRD and their role in treatment selection remain unknown. We propose a resource-driven, patient-centered study to determine the genetic/genomic drivers of HRD predicting “deep” response to abiraterone and enzalutamide. We hypothesize that mCRPC patients can be categorized into three groups according to HRD status defined by deleterious mutations in HRD genes: 1) germline/somatic HRD; 2) somatic-only HRD; 3) negative HRD; and that these groups are molecularly distinct, and have different clinical implications as predictive markers of response to AR-targeting therapies and taxane chemotherapies. To address the overall hypothesis, it is necessary to establish clinical and tumor/normal specimen cohorts that enable detailed molecular and clinical characterization of HRD in men with mCRPC. In Specific Aim 1, we will seek to ascertain the HRD mutations status, both somatic and germline, in three existing advanced/lethal prostate cancer cohorts enriched for HRD using blood-based assays. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the association of HRD status defined by blood-based assays with treatment response to first-line AR-directed therapy (abiraterone/enzalutamide) and taxane chemotherapies in mCRPC patients by comparing treatment outcomes of men in these three groups. In Specific Aim 3, we seek to determine the expression correlates of HRD status defined by blood-based assays and further ascertained by tissue-based assays, by performing RNA-Seq in surgical specimens from men with lethal prostate cancer with: 1) germline/somatic HRD; 2) somatic-only HRD; and 3) negative HRD. The proposed work addresses an unmet need due to focus on liquid biopsy markers in a vulnerable patient population facing difficult treatment decisions. Also, our effort in defining the clinical and functional implications of HRD status in established cohorts of mCRPC patients will directly lead to treatment selection strategies to improve clinical management as well as patient selection strategies for clinical trials.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2909,404,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,

Dual-trained as a veterinarian and pharmacologist, Dr. Peters has a strong background in comparative medicine, animal models of human disease, in vivo pharmacology, and protease biology. Through completion of the training and research aims outlined in this proposal, she will expand her knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and build an advanced technical skill set, to include immunofluorescent imaging, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and gastrointestinal phenotyping methods, that will form a solid foundation for her planned independent research program. IBD is a chronic condition that negatively impacts patient quality of life and is associated with a high public health burden. There is no cure for IBD and a large percentage of affected individuals are unresponsive to all available treatments. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) is zinc metallopeptidase that is highly overexpressed in the two main subtypes of IBD: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The promise of GCPII as a therapeutic target in IBD has been demonstrated in multiple independent preclinical studies, which have shown that small molecule GCPII inhibitors have significant anti-colitis activity in three mechanistically-distinct mouse models. While it is apparent that GCPII upregulation is relevant in both human and mouse IBD, knowledge gaps exist regarding its function in disease. This K01 SERCA research will yield critical new data relevant to the biology of GCPII in IBD. Specifically, in Aim #1 GCPII expression will be defined in normal and IBD-affected gastrointestinal tissues of human and mouse IBD. In Aim #2, a novel knock-in mouse will be generated that overexpresses human GCPII in the ileum and colon, followed by longitudinal characterization of barrier function, gastrointestinal inflammation, microbiome composition and visceral pain response. It is hypothesized that the localization of GCPII overexpression will be conserved in human and mouse IBD and that adult mice with forced ileum and colon GCPII overexpression will spontaneously develop colitis. Successful completion of these research aims will (1) increase our understanding of GCPII dysregulation in IBD, (2) identify GCPII+ target cell populations with relevance to ongoing to drug development efforts and (3) yield a novel mouse model of IBD that may have increased similarity to human disease. The proposed research will be supervised by a multidisciplinary team of expert scientists and clinicians including: Dr. Barbara Slusher, Director of Johns Hopkins Drug Discovery, Dr. Pankaj Jay Pasricha, Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Neurogastroenterology, Dr. Cynthia Sears, Director of the Johns Hopkins Germ Free Murine Core, Dr. Robert Anders, Gastrointestinal Pathologist, Dr. Christine McDonald, expert in Gastrointestinal Barrier Function, and Dr. Thaddeus Stappenbeck, Gastrointestinal Pathologist and expert in Mucosal Immunity, who are well-suited to mentor Dr. Diane Peters in her translational IBD research career.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3170,461,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5F31HL156741-03,Elucidating the Endothelial-Smooth Muscle Cell Interactions in Marfan Syndrome Using iPSCs,"Project Summary Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue caused by mutations in the fibrillin- 1(FBN1) gene. These mutations cause increased vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) apoptosis, increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, excessive elastin degeneration and collagen overexpression; weakening the vascular architecture, impair hemodynamic regulation, and ultimately leading to severe vascular complications. Primary cells, tissue explants, and transgenic mouse models suffer from insufficiencies that inhibit development of novel insights into disease pathogenesis or potential therapeutics; warranting new modeling platforms. Recent advances in biomaterials have generated vascular grafts that mimic properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the natural vasculature. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are an ideal, patient specific renewable cell source that provides an avenue to study how genetic diseases effect cell mechanobiology, signaling and function to better development therapeutics. Here, using a natural fibrin-based vascular graft and hiPSCs from patients with Marfan Syndrome, we aim to: (1) fully characterized both ECs and contractile vSMCs from hiPSCs derived from Marfan patients, (2) study the responses of hiPSC-ECs to shear force and hiPSC-vSMCs to circumferential strain, (3) study the impacts of mechanical forces (i.e. shear force and circumferential strain) and paracrine signaling in a co-culture model, specifically reactive oxygen species(ROS), on vSMC phenotype and rate of graft degradation using the fibrin-based vascular graft. Our multidisciplinary approach underpinning this project will elucidate key mediators of MFS disease progression towards early detection and therapeutic targets.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,1785,238,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R03DK134595-02,Elucidating mechanisms of fibrosis associated with the Crohns disease-associated pathogenic variant in the metal transporter ZIP8,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, affect 1 in 200 Americans. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapies remain the cornerstone of therapy for patients with IBD, but approximately 40% of patients will experience primary or secondary loss of response, and “anti- TNF-experienced” patients are less likely to respond to all subsequent therapies in current clinical practice. Single-cell RNA sequencing has uncovered key cellular signatures associated with anti-TNF refractoriness that strongly implicate signaling between inflammatory macrophages and activated fibroblasts. There remains a major gap in our understanding of the patient-specific factors that predispose to this aberrant macrophage- fibroblast activation, how it links to anti-TNF unresponsiveness, and the potential to modulate it to change to disease course and treatment response. Our work has focused on the functional implications of a pathogenic variant in a metal transporter, ZIP8 A391T, that dysregulates manganese homeostasis and is associated with complicated (stricturing and penetrating) Crohn’s disease. In studying ZIP8 391-Thr in a mouse model (Zip8 393T-knock-in (KI)), we have shown increased susceptibility to colitis, but even more interestingly, we have observed enhanced fibrosis. These mice also exhibit marked induction of Il-11, a pro-inflammatory and pro- fibrotic cytokine that is a hallmark of aberrant signaling between inflammatory macrophages and activated fibroblasts in patients with Crohn’s disease – particularly anti-TNF refractory disease. We therefore hypothesize that study of aberrant macrophage-fibroblast signaling is a key feature of disease pathogenesis in the Zip8 393T-KI mice. Establishing the underlying disease mechanisms are important because (1) up to 25% of patients with Crohn’s disease carry ZIP8 391-Thr in some populations and (2) the Zip8 393T-KI could serve as a novel translational model for mechanistic studies, particularly related to anti-TNF non-response. We will study this hypothesis in two aims: In Aim 1, we will determine if Zip8 393T-KI perturbs macrophage innate immune responses; in Aim 2, we will compare fibroblast activation induced by Zip8 393T-KI vs. WT Zip8 macrophages. The long-term goal is to establish if ZIP8 391-Thr genotype has clinical implications for the prevention of and treatment of patients with Crohn’s disease and use study of ZIP8 391-Thr-related pathology as key opportunity to elucidate the role of Mn homeostasis in human disease. This R03 application builds from a K08 that established the altered Mn homeostasis and fibroinflammatory phenotype in colitis in Zip8 393T-KI mice. This application with strong translational relevance will provide critical mechanistic insight of the ZIP8 genotypic effect on macrophage-fibroblast signaling and the interaction with Mn homeostasis to prioritize therapeutic targets, including STAT3 or IL-11 inhibition, and patient studies as part of an R01 application.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3038,431,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5K08HL163468-02,Determinants of Myeloid Clonal Evolution,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Clonal hematopoiesis is acquired with aging, and in some cases, precedes the onset of both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders. However, the genetic drivers that underlie the evolution of clonal hematopoiesis and the subsequent disease risk remain poorly understood. This proposal builds on generated evidence showing that telomere length, a genetic and clinically available biomarker, predisposes to clonal hematopoiesis in Mendelian syndromes. We have also found evidence for distinct clonal hematopoiesis mutations that appear to differentially predispose to hypoplastic and myeloproliferative phenotypes. In this application, we will examine the role of telomere length in driving clonal evolution with aging in well- characterized cohorts including a Baltimore-based cohort of community-based women with a large African American subset. Additionally, we will also examine the onset and prevalence of a novel clonal hematopoiesis mutation in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene that appears to be protective against myeloid malignancies. This K08 grant application is supported by outstanding mentors and in a strong translational environment at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine with a detailed mentorship and training plan that focuses on genetic epidemiology and computational biology skills. The knowledge has the potential to impact current paradigms related to hematopoietic aging, myeloid clonal disease risk as well as novel biomarkers of specific disease risk and progression.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,1535,212,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
2R35GM130393-06,Mechanistic studies of chromatin modification in transcription regulation,"PROJECT SUMMARY Post-translational modifications of the histone proteins that package DNA play a central role in regulating transcription and repair of DNA damage. The goal of this research program is to determine the molecular mechanism by which attachment of the small protein, ubiquitin, to histone proteins functions in concert with modifications including methylation and acetylation to regulate gene expression. Since misregulation of histone ubiquitination and methylation characterizes many cancers, the results of these studies can be used to design new drugs that target the molecular machines involved in these pathways. A major focus will be on the mechanisms by which histone H2B-K120 monoubiquitination orchestrates multiple events during transcription that result in gene activation. A multidisciplinary approach combining cryo-electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, solution biochemistry and cell-based approaches will be used to study the mechanism by which ubiquitin is specifically attached to histone H2B during transcription and the distinct mechanisms by which different deubiquitinating enzymes distinguish between H2B in intact versus partially disassembled nucleosomes. We will also determine the nature of intra- and inter-nucleosomal cross-talk between histone ubiquitination, methylation and acetylation mediated by transcriptional activators that act downstream of H2B ubiquitination. Building upon the recent discovery of first-in-class macrocyclic inhibitors of the human SAGA H2B deubiquitinating enzyme, we will determine their mechanism of action and derive principles that will drive further drug discovery of multi-subunit deubiquitinating enzymes. To elucidate the molecular basis by which H2B ubiquitination drives cell proliferation in MLL-rearranged leukeumia, we will uncover the role of histone ubiquitination in stimulating the activity of MLL1 fusion complexes that result from chromosomal rearrangements. The molecular insights that will result from the proposed studies will provide a foundation for developing new chemotherapies that target cancers for which there currently are no effective treatments.",2024,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2155,290,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
3U01AI138897-05S2,HOPE in Action: A Clinical Trial of HIV-to-HIV Liver Transplantation,"End-stage liver disease is common in HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals due to co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Liver transplant (LT) in HIV+ individuals provides a clear survival benefit and outcomes will improve further with direct-acting antivirals for HCV. There is already a severe organ shortage, with long waiting times, and a higher waitlist mortality for HIV+ individuals in particular, and the need for LT in HIV+ individuals is expected to grow. Organs from HIV+ deceased donors (HIV D+) are a unique resource for HIV+ transplant candidates. By expanding the donor pool, use of organs from HIV D+ could have a significant public health impact and decrease wait times for all individuals on the waitlist. This motivated the Congressional HOPE (HIV Organ Policy Equity) Act which now allows HIV D+ transplants for HIV+ recipients (R+) under research protocols. Potential risks of HIV D+/R+ transplants include complications related to donor-to-recipient HIV superinfection (HIV-SI), increased organ rejection rates, and accelerated liver fibrosis and/or steatosis after transplant due to viral hepatitis or metabolic liver disease. Experience with HIV D+ LT is extremely limited with only 2 international cases reported and 5 cases in the US performed by our group within a HOPE pilot study. In order to determine if HIV D+ liver transplantation is safe and effective, a prospective multicenter trial is needed. The proposed HOPE in Action Liver Trial will compare outcomes between HIV+ recipients of HIV+ versus HIV- donor livers, enrolling 40 individuals in each group over 3 years at 16 transplant centers. Aim 1 will compare difference in time to major transplant-related and HIV-related complications between the two arms. Aim 2 will compare the incidence of liver disease including HCV- and HBV-related fibrosis and liver steatosis. Mechanistic studies in Aim 3 will characterize HIV-SI in blood and in Aim 4 will characterize both the composition and changes in size of long-lived HIV reservoirs in blood, lymph nodes, and liver longitudinally. A comprehensive digital pathologic repository and a tissue biorepository will be created. We have planned and designed the trial with NIAID-sponsored project team (R34AI23023) and we have assembled a team of experts in Transplant Surgery, HIV/Infectious Diseases, Hepatology, Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Pathology, and Virology. The trial will benefit from existing studies and infrastructure established by our group, including a study of HIV D+ nationally in collaboration with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (R01AI120938) and a Multicenter HOPE in Action Kidney Trial (U01AI134591). In summary, HOPE in Action: A clinical trial of HIV-to-HIV deceased donor liver transplantation will determine whether the use of HIV D+ for LT is safe and effective. In addition, the trial will impact not only the field of organ transplantation, but will also provide new insight into mechanisms of HIV-related liver disease, HIV superinfection, and will directly inform HIV cure research efforts.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3158,476,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01CA255259-03,A First-in-Class FAP-activated Protoxin to disrupt the Tumor-Stroma Parasitic Cycle fueling lethal Prostate Cancer Progression,"Though initially responsive to hormonal therapy, prostate cancer (PCa) invariably progresses to an incurable metastatic castration-resistant state (mCRPC). Additionally, the proportion of patients with androgen receptor (AR)-indifferent mCRPCe has increased significantly in the post-supracastration (e.g. -enzalutamide/- abiraterone) era in men with late-stage lethal disease. Whether treatment-induced or otherwise, this emphasizes the urgent need to develop innovative non-AR targeted approaches if we want to do more than provide incremental increases in patient survival and combat this emerging highly-aggressive lethal phenotype. Tumor- infiltrating fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-positive cells (i.e. MSCs, CAFs, and TAMs) are recognized as key architects of the pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to tumor progression. This is in part through their production of energy-rich nutrients and metabolic intermediates that the cancer cells “parasitize” from the extracellular fluid to fuel tumor growth and progression. These observations suggest that a FAP-targeted therapy could provide an AR-independent multi-faceted anti-tumor assault by simultaneously disrupting the parasitic dependence on the tumor stroma and eliminating multiple immunosuppressive cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To accomplish this goal, we have synthesized an orally-available small molecule FAP-activated mitochondrial protoxin based on niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic that uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with nanomolar potency in a cell cycle-independent manner, making it an ideal warhead for FAP+ stromal cells with a low proliferative index. This proposal is innovative from conceptual and technical perspectives: 1) multiple tumor-infiltrating FAP+ cells in the TME are selectively and simultaneously targeted to overcome the immune barrier and disrupt the “parasitic cycle” fueling tumor growth; 2) a first-in-class enzymatically-activated lipophilic mitochondrial protoxin designed to increase the therapeutic index of an FDA-approved drug while sparing toxicity to surrounding healthy tissue is synthesized and characterized; 3) FAP expression patterns in a unique series of human prostate tissues, lymph nodes, and metastases as a function of malignancy and treatment status are assessed to identify clinical states most likely to benefit from FAP-targeted therapy; and 4) efficacy, toxicity, and specificity are evaluated using a novel series of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and syngeneic models that recapitulate key clinical features of human PCa in order to delineate biologically-relevant immune-independent and –dependent mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor response. Furthermore, this strategy combines agents that have been individually tested in patients, which significantly bolsters potential for near-term patient benefit. More immediately, the proposal will provide important insights into the role of FAP+ cells in PCa pathophysiology particularly with respect to their interaction with the immune system, while providing the necessary preclinical proof-of-principle data needed to translate this innovative therapeutic platform into the clinic.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3241,420,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DK124343-03,A Glucocorticoid Receptor-SETDB2 Co-Regulated Liver Metabolic Gene Program,"Excess glucocorticoids contribute to the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which includes: obesity, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis. Glucocorticoids exert their physiological effects via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a transcription factor that binds chromatin at GRE motifs leading to gene activation or repression. Our published work identified a previously unrecognized mechanism for GR-mediated gene regulation through its collaboration with the SET domain-containing protein, SETDB2, to activate a select subset of GR gene targets in the liver associated with diabetes. We showed livers of mice deficient in SETDB2 have a significantly blunted glucocorticoid response as demonstrated by fasting hypoglycemia and lack of induction of key GR target genes. Since inhibition of glucocorticoid action in liver can prevent the negative metabolic effects of glucocorticoid-induced diabetes, we hypothesize that liver-specific SETDB2-knockout (DB2-LKO) mice will be partially protected from metabolic dysfunction when exposed to conditions that lead to elevated glucocorticoids. Fundamental mechanisms associated with glucocorticoid-induced metabolic disease are studied by evaluating the effects of liver-specific DB2-LKO and liver-specific GR-LKO on glucose/lipid homeostasis under conditions of elevated endogenous glucocorticoids (diet- induced obesity) or exogenous glucocorticoid administration. Metabolic parameters associated with diabetes will be measured: weight gain, glucose-intolerance, insulin-resistance, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. Additionally, the molecular mechanism for the combined action of SETDB2 and GR will be characterized within these experimental paradigms and novel gene targets and chromatin targeting will be identified by RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and Hi-ChIP. Integrating the proposed experiments will provide a better understanding of how SETDB2 affects the positive and negative actions of GR that are relevant to metabolic disease in the liver. The fundamental mechanism studied may provide a pathway to target SETDB2’s role in GR action as a new therapeutic target for glucocorticoid-induced diabetes and metabolic disease. The experiments a balance of mechanistic and exploratory studies in mouse models to investigate the regulation of hepatic metabolic processes that are directly relevant to human disease. The results from both aims will be integrated together to reveal the overlapping and unique mechanisms by which the SETDB2-GR regulatory axis contributes to the adaptation of the liver to acute nutritional (Aim 1), chronic nutritional and hormonal (Aim 2) states of metabolic stress.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2694,360,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01CA082337-19,Hostile Environments Promote Invasion and Metastasis,"Inflammation plays a major role in breast cancer development and progression. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and its product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are major mediators of inflammation in cancer cells. In this competitive renewal application, our new directions are built on discoveries made during the previous funding period. With imaging we uncovered the role of COX-2 in mechanotransduction, its impact on attracting cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), altering collagen fiber structure and function, and increasing metastasis. We found that COX-2 overexpression in tumors impacted tumor and spleen metabolism that opens the possibility of spleen dysregulation contributing to tumors escaping immune surveillance. In our efforts to downregulate COX-2 in tumors with siRNA delivery, we found that most nanoparticles (NPs) significantly increased COX-2, until we developed a biocompatible translatable dextran NP that successfully delivered COX-2 siRNA to effectively decrease COX-2 and PGE2 in cancer cells and tumors. These observations have resulted in our three new aims that focus on advancing our understanding COX-2 in cancer, and in developing translatable strategies to target COX-2 and CAFs. In Aim 1 will investigate the role of COX-2 in altering extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and composition, and the impact of eliminating CAFs that are a source of COX-2, on the ECM and on tumor immune cells and metastasis. In Aim 2 we will identify the causes of the metabolic changes in the tumor and spleen caused by COX-2, and the effects of eliminating CAFs on tumor and spleen metabolism, and splenocytes. In Aim 3 we will downregulate COX-2 in established tumors with siRNA and determine the impact on the ECM, metabolism, and immune cells. A small component of this Aim will include developing cytokine scavenging NPs that are based on the modified dextran NP we developed. We will evaluate the ability of these NPs to reduce cytokines in tumor interstitial fluid. The studies will be performed with triple negative breast cancer models genetically engineered to overexpress or downregulate COX-2 in immune suppressed and immune competent mice.

In three major Aims, we propose to undertake fundamental biochemical and structural studies of representatives from two major families of iterative polyketide synthases, which exemplify some of the most sophisticated catalytic systems known and pose many unanswered questions about how the coordinated function of their individual catalytic domains is achieved. Unequivocal determination of the programmed product of the enediyne highly-reducing (HR)-PKSs will be extended to investigation of how this simple, shared intermediate is converted to the enediyne and anthraquinone “halves” of dynemicin A and other enediyne architectures. With advances in antibody technology, conjugates of enediyne natural products are coming again as valuable anti-cancer therapies. The biosynthesis of these structurally intriguing DNA-cleaving molecules remains one of the principal unsolved problems in natural product biosynthesis. Application of precise CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletions in the dynemicin A pathway has brought exciting experimental advances to isolate and characterize the first post-PKS intermediates in any enediyne biosynthetic pathway. Additional mutational studies will be carried out, the structures of other possible intermediates will be elucidated and a strategy of paired CRISPR mutations will be developed to finally crack how these fascinating structures are made.

This new application focuses on studying a newly discovered neuronal specific abundant proteasome complex and its link to neuronal function in health and aging related neurodegenerative disease. Based on extensive original findings, our central hypothesis is that neuronal activity promotes the degradation of newly synthesized proteins through a transmembrane-like proteasome complex in order to rapidly generate biologically meaningful peptides that are critical for normal nervous system function and appear protective against neurodegenerative processes. The rationale for the proposed research is that nothing is known about this new form of protein homeostasis and further understanding is critical in providing vital insight into neuronal functions mediated by protein degradation. Given the critical importance of protein degradation to human health, the long-range objective of the proposed research is to understand the regulation and function of this degradation program and to apply this knowledge to the detection and eventual treatment of cognitive disorders.

5K00AG068440-04,Cortical Inhibition and Mobility in Older Adults,"Nearly 25% of Americans age 65+ report serious mobility problems. Mobility impairments decrease quality of life and predict increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality. However, the contribution of age-related brain changes to mobility impairments is not well understood. F99 work will examine how cortical inhibitory function relates to gait and balance declines with aging. K00 work will examine the same questions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and test exercise as an intervention to improve cortical inhibitory function. The sponsor's (Dr. Rachael Seidler) past work supports the novel hypothesis that declines in cortical inhibitory processes at least partially underlie motor impairments with aging. For Aim 1 (F99), the candidate is collecting two measures of lower limb cortical inhibition in 30 young and 30 older adults: 1) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 2) transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced cortical silent period. GABA-edited MRS provides a measure of GABA neurotransmitter concentration, while cortical silent periods provide a measure of functional cortical inhibition during muscle activity. The F99 work addresses whether these two measures of cortical inhibition are reduced in older age (Aim 1a) and whether cortical inhibition relates to individual differences in gait (Aim 1b) and balance (Aim 1c). Mobility is often more impaired in MCI than in healthy aging. Motor symptoms typically arise much earlier than cognitive symptoms, and presence of motor symptoms relates to higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. Past work suggests that cortical inhibitory function is impaired in MCI and dementia, supporting that changes in cortical inhibition could be a component of MCI. Thus, for Aim 2 (K00), the candidate will work with Dr. Kirk Erickson to test whether cortical inhibition is reduced in MCI compared to healthy aging (Aim 2a) and if cortical inhibition relates to gait and balance in MCI (Aim 2b). Given relationships between cortical inhibition and motor control in healthy adults, it is feasible that cortical inhibition changes could also relate to mobility declines in MCI. Understanding neurotransmitter systems involved in mobility declines is important for development of interventions. Thus, the candidate will test whether aerobic exercise influences cortical inhibition in aging and MCI (Aim 2c). Past work demonstrated effects of exercise on cortical inhibition in young adults, but this has yet to be tested in aging or MCI. This work directly contributes to the NIA's major goals of preserving mobility in aging and studying brain changes with MCI. To successfully complete these aims, the candidate will receive extensive training from an expert mentorship team in biomechanics, brain imaging, brain stimulation, MCI, and exercise intervention work. This training will provide the candidate with a comprehensive toolkit to succeed as an aging researcher, with my future independent research program focused on: 1) determining the brain changes that contribute to motor declines in older age and MCI, and 2) identifying interventions to preserve motor function in older age and MCI.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3187,474,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01EB029455-04,Immunoengineered nanotechnology for targeted expansion of regulatory T cells,"Development of an immunoengineered technology to selectively stimulate and expand regulatory T (TReg) cells in vivo would be transformative for autoimmune disease treatment and transplantation medicine. Extensive evidence has established that adoptively transferred TReg cells, and in particular antigen-specific TReg cells, effectively suppress pathogenic autoimmune activity to combat disease. However, logistical and manufacturing complications as well as safety concerns associated with ex vivo expanded T cells impede clinical adoption of this approach. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for an off-the-shelf, non-cellular platform that activates antigen-specific TReg cells to manifest immunosuppression directly in patients. The interleukin-2 (IL-2) cytokine potently activates TReg cells, and has proven to be a promising alternative to adoptive TReg cell transfer. However, IL-2 concurrently stimulates activation of effector cells, resulting in harmful off-target effects and toxicities. Co- administration of IL-2 in complex with certain anti-cytokine antibodies preferentially activates and expands TReg over effector cells, but concerns about cytokine/antibody complex dissociation hinder the therapeutic development of this approach. Furthermore, IL-2 treatment induces non-specific expansion of TReg cells, with limited enrichment of therapeutically superior antigen-specific cells. This proposal aims to develop a robust and versatile platform that activates antigen-specific TReg cells and simultaneously inhibits the function of pathogenic autoreactive T cells. This technology synthesizes, for the first time, three design approaches: (1) Selective delivery of IL-2 to TReg cells; (2) Stimulation of antigen-specific TReg cells using artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs); and (3) Localized release of an immunosuppressive drug to prevent effector T cell activation. The novel platform, denoted TolAPC, comprises nanoparticles coated with self peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (MHC) as well as a stabilized single-chain fusion format of an IL-2/antibody complex that selectively promotes TReg expansion. These particles are also engineered for controlled release of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin. TolAPCs will be characterized in vitro and in vivo to assess selective expansion of TReg cells that can suppress pathogenic self-reactive effector T cells. They will also be therapeutically evaluated in autoimmune disease studies in mice. As a model system, TolAPC activity will be assessed in type 1 diabetes (T1D), a chronic autoimmune disease that is a growing threat to global health with incidence rising at an alarming rate of 3% annually. The modularity of the TolAPC platform will allow for ready extension to a host of applications in autoimmune disease treatment and transplant tolerance through substitution of the antigen specificity. Overall, our targeted immunomodulatory nanotechnology will serve as a powerful and general tool for biasing immune activation to effect therapeutically relevant outcomes.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3064,415,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01NS106292-05,Biomarkers of Brain Injury in Critically-Ill Children on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO),"PROJECT SUMMARY With advances in technology, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe refractory heart and lung failure has quadrupled in children and increased tenfold in adults in the last 15 years. ECMO is life-saving, but costly, resource-intensive, and high-risk. Up to 30% of pediatric ECMO patients develop neurologic injury. Mortality increases by 89% if injury occurs, and 10%-60% of survivors have clinically important neurologic disability that impairs normal development and school performance. We currently lack the ability to accurately stratify children at risk for death or disability, and to diagnose injury in subclinical phase, thus missing the window for potential neuroprotective interventions. The overall goal of this research is to develop and refine a brain injury multimarker panel for accurate neurologic monitoring at the bedside and early classification of mortality and disability outcomes that will allow real-time neuroprotective interventions, with the ultimate goal to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes of these critically ill children. We hypothesize that circulating markers of brain injury and inflammation can assist in diagnosing difficult-to-image neurologic injury; provide real-time feedback to neuroprotective or potentially deleterious interventions in the intensive care unit; identify patients at risk for long-term neurologic disability; and serve as entry criteria and benchmarks of therapeutic efficacy in future interventional clinical trials through a more refined approach than is currently possible. Based on preliminary data from single and two-center studies, we propose a multicenter prospective observational study (9 centers, 225 subjects) that will seek to determine the association between plasma and imaging markers of brain injury and inflammation during ECMO and short and long-term survival and neurologic outcomes of critically-ill children who require extracorporeal support. Using targeted and discovery approaches, we will address our overall goal in the following specific aims, with the support and well-established research infrastructure of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group and the Kennedy Krieger Institute: (1) Determine if circulating levels of brain injury markers during ECMO and brain MRI abnormalities at 2 weeks after ECMO are associated with survival at 18 months after ECMO with a score ≥85 on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, third edition (VABS-III); (2) Determine whether the presence and degree of inflammation during ECMO and markers of neuroinflammation on brain MRS at 2 weeks after ECMO are associated with survival at 18 months after ECMO with a score ≥85 on VABS-III; (3) Determine whether metabolic and lipid neuroinflammatory pathways will distinguish between at-risk for, acute, and recovery phases of neurologic injury during ECMO.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2923,416,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01EY031044-03,Muller cell activation and remodeling in AMD.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex, multifactorial disease. I have recently reported subretinal Müller cell membranes in areas of geographic atrophy (GA). These membranes closely mimic areas of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) and choriocapillaris loss. I have also observed Müller cells anterior to drusen expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and appearing to migrate to the ONL in eyes with AMD. These data indicate Müller cell activation and remodeling in AMD. The stimuli for and consequences of these changes, however, are not understood. We hypothesize that changes to the subretinal milieu in non-neovascular AMD stimulate Müller cell activation and remodeling that exacerbates AMD pathology. The first Aim of this proposal will investigate how Müller cells are affected by subretinal changes that occur in AMD. We will investigate Müller cell morphological and metabolic changes anterior to drusen in human donor eyes with AMD. We will then evaluate the Müller cell response to drusen components, amyloid beta and oxidized lipids, in vitro. The second subAim of Aim 1 will determine the effect that RPE cells exert on Müller cells. While these cells are normally separated by the photoreceptor segments, subretinal pathology as well as their abnormal migration and extension allows them to touch in eyes with AMD. We will analyze the RPE influence on Müller cells using human AMD tissue and cell culture experiments. The second proposed Aim focuses on how Müller cells in the subretinal space affect neighboring cells. We will first investigate how Müller cells affect RPE cells using cell culture experiments. We will also investigate extracellular vesicle release by Müller cells and, if present, determine what effect these have on RPE cells. We will also investigate the composition of the subretinal glial membranes that we have observed in GA. Since it is not possible to determine in human retinas how early in the disease process glia intrude the subretinal space, we have developed a rat model with focal RPE cell atrophy. We will also determine whether these glial membranes form a scar which will prevent the flow of material, including future stem cell therapy, from the retina to subretinal space. Finally, we will inhibit the membrane and determine how this affects disease progression in our rat model of RPE atrophy. These studies will determine the role glia play in AMD pathology, potentially identifying novel treatments. By investigating extracellular vesicle and exosome release from Müllers, our studies will identify how Müller cells interact with other cell types in the normal and diseased retina.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2666,415,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R03MH128634-02,Causal mediation analysis in mental health with mediator missingness,"PROJECT SUMMARY Examining the mechanisms behind exposures and interventions is crucial in mental health research; doing so can help identify potential intervention targets and tailor interventions to optimize outcomes. Causal mediation analysis is an important tool for this job. An important but under-appreciated challenge in mediation analysis is missing data. Missing data are ubiquitous (even in high quality mental health studies) and are more of a challenge in mediation analyses than in standard analyses, due to the involvement of more variables. Missingness tends to be worse when the analysis involves multiple mediators and/or when data collection at intermediate time points (when mediators are measured) receives less attention than baseline and outcome data collection. Since most methodological work assumes complete data, it is not yet well understood how to appropriately handle missing data when conducting causal mediation analysis. As the first step in removing this barrier to effective use of causal mediation analysis in mental health researcher, this project will tackle the problem of mediator missingness, a common problem in practice and a particularly important one to tackle for the validity of mediation analyses. This project will develop two classes of methods for this purpose: (1) with the estimating equations approach, we will transform each of a collection of full-data methods to observed-data methods that are doubly robust – consistent if either a missingness model or a model for some relevant function of the mediator given observed data is correct; (2) to respond to the popularity of multiple imputation, based on each full-data method, we will develop targeted multiple imputation procedures tailored to the method and the effects being estimated, to minimize bias due to misspecification of the imputation model. The project seeks methods that can be explained intuitively, and will pay special attention to communicating and disseminating the methods developed to mental health researchers. For illustration, the methods will be applied to an analysis of effects of a treatment for anxiety disorder and an analysis of disparities in suicidality affecting sexual minority youth.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2225,333,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5K23AI143965-04,Using BTK Inhibitors to Prevent Anaphylactic Drug Reactions,"This proposal describes a 5-year training award to develop the academic career of the principal investigator, Melanie C. Dispenza, MD, PhD, a board-certified allergist-immunologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Her qualifications and background, combined with her current research in preventing IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils, make her uniquely qualified to study novel therapies to prevent anaphylaxis. During the period of this proposal, Dr. Dispenza will continue to devote at least 75% effort towards patient-oriented translational research. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening IgE-mediated systemic allergic reaction with no known preventative therapies. There is a huge unmet need for therapies that can reduce the frequency and/or severity of anaphylactic reactions from both accidental and intentional exposures, the latter including desensitizations and immunotherapy. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key component of FcεRI signaling in human mast cells and basophils. Pharmacologic inhibitors of BTK are generally well tolerated, and preliminary data show that BTK inhibitors effectively block IgE-mediated human mast cell and basophil activation in vitro and in mouse models of anaphylaxis in vivo. Thus, it may be possible to utilize BTK inhibitors to proactively prevent allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that short-term use of FDA-approved BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib will prevent medication-induced anaphylaxis in both mouse models of anaphylaxis and in humans. If successful, BTK inhibitors could potentially be used to make drug desensitization safer and more cost effective, thus improving patient care and outcomes. Through this proposed research, Dr. Dispenza will work towards her long-term goal of becoming an independent translational physician-scientist. Short-term goals include (1) expanding research skills in mast cell biology, (2) learning to implement novel humanized mouse models of anaphylaxis, and (3) acquiring biostatistical and clinical trial skills for study design and implementation. After completion of this award, Dr. Dispenza will have had the needed training to design and implement further studies on the development of novel strategies to prevent anaphylaxis. To achieve these goals, an excellent mentoring team has been assembled. The primary mentor, Bruce Bochner, MD (Professor, Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine), has a strong track record of translational research in allergy including mast cell biology and has successfully trained many academicians. Donald MacGlashan, Jr, MD, PhD (Director, Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Johns Hopkins University), will serve as co-mentor, with additional expertise in mast cell and basophil activation and signaling. The mentoring team will oversee Dr. Dispenza’s progress in developing the necessary skills in order to support her transition into an independent investigator.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3024,422,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
1U24NS129499-01,Network for Emergency Care Clinical Trials: Strategies to Innovate EmeRgENcy Care Clinical Trials Network (SIREN),"The objective of this proposal is to create a new Clinical Center (Hub) organized by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Department of Emergency Medicine (JHM DEM) for the SIREN research program. The JHM Hub- and-Spoke network is comprised of nine fully committed Spoke institutions with the capacity to recruit from more than 25 unique clinical sites across five states and Washington, DC. Annual ED census of the network exceeds 1.6 million visits with strong representation of minority, socioeconomically disadvantaged and rural populations. Emergency medical services (EMS) systems associated with Hub and spokes have committed to the SIREN program through direct participation in research conducted with the JHM Hub-and-Spoke network. The JHM DEM will leverage extensive clinical research experience a robust institutional research environment to make immediate and meaningful contributions to the national SIREN program and to improve outcomes for patients with neurologic, cardiac, respiratory, hematologic, and traumatic conditions. The JHM DEM has been continuously engaged in clinical research since 1985 and is a consistent national leader in annual publications and grants, total research funding, NIH funding, and total faculty with funded research. To date, the JHM DEM has enrolled tens of thousands of patients in prospective emergency care research. The JHM Hub-and-Spoke network will achieve success for SIREN through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Create a Hub network administrative structure that guarantees efficient and effective recruitment for and execution of SIREN clinical trials. An innovative Hub-of-Hubs network design will allow for rapid scalability to meet individual SIREN trial needs. Tools to facilitate effective and efficient recruitment, protocol execution, data entry, and quality assurance will be disseminated across the JHM SIREN network. Aim 2. Promote diversity of inclusion in SIREN clinical trials and clinical research leadership. Improving health outcomes for underserved communities is a core clinical and research mission of JHM; promoting representation of these groups in SIREN studies will be a major focus of the JHM SIREN Hub. A second major focus will be inclusion and multi-site mentorship of women and underrepresented racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities within our Hub-and-Spoke research team. Aim 3. Train future leaders in emergency care clinical trials research. Our Hub network will serve as a training environment for junior emergency care investigators (residents, fellows, junior faculty, nurses, EMS providers). Junior investigators will gain mentored experience in clinical trials research through workshops and didactics developed by the Hub, execution of SIREN trials, and participation in technical working groups including those focused on optimizing trial implementation and development of new trial proposals. These aims will be executed through a tripartite Hub organizational structure that includes (1) an Administrative Core, (2) a Governance Core, and (3) Technical Working Groups.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3068,442,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01DA035943-10,Mechanisms of Dopamine Action in Learning: Implications for Addiction,"Project summary Mesolimbic dopamine, along with its ventral striatal targets, plays a major role in Pavlovian reward learning. Pavlovian reward learning processes underlie many aspects of drug seeking behavior and play a critical role in drug relapse. Instrumental learning processes also form a fundamental element of drug seeking behavior, and may depend on nigrostriatal dopamine innervation of dorsal striatum. Here we seek to understand how mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine action within striatal targets mediates select components of reward-seeking behavior, and to test whether interactions between these systems contribute to normal and pathological reward-seeking behavior. We focus on dopamine because both natural and drug rewards activate dopamine neurons, and, as confirmed in our recent findings, dopamine neuron activation, when substituted for reward, drives specific forms of associative learning implicated in addictive behavior. Here, using the Th:Cre transgenic rat to limit channelrhodopsin expression to dopamine neurons, we take advantage of the ability to selectively activate mesolimbic dopamine neurons to better understand their impact on behavior, neural activity, and integration of ventral and dorsal striatal systems. We test whether mesolimbic dopamine neuron reward-related activation recruits more dorsal striatal circuits during specific forms of learning. A prominent hypothesis posits that reward seeking depends over time on more dorsal striatal circuits as behavioral control becomes habitual. Thus, we also ask whether activating mesolimbic dopamine systems can hasten development of habitual responding for natural or drug reward. In addition, we will determine neural signals mediating behaviors conditioned by mesolimbic dopamine activation in order to reveal neural changes in downstream neuronal populations that mediate the performance of these dopamine-mediated learned behaviors. These studies will provide new information on the separate and interactive contributions of ventral and dorsal striatal circuits to reward seeking behavior that can be initiated by dopamine, and are relevant for our understanding of behavioral disorders involving overeating and substance use disorders.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2236,307,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01AG065171-02,Cognitive Vulnerability to Stress in Individuals at Risk for Alzheimer's Disease,"In the wake of discouraging results from treatment trials in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the need to identify novel approaches is urgent. There is emerging consensus that the lack of efficacy in AD clinical trials is attributable to disease heterogeneity. Accordingly, identifying predictors of specific AD endophenotypes that could become targets for intervention is of great interest. Among potential options, compelling evidence implicates the stress response as a promising candidate. Indeed, findings from numerous studies converge on the notion that individuals with a heightened sensitivity to stress are at greater risk of developing AD, suggesting that these individuals may represent a group who could be targeted in AD treatment trials. Translating these findings into clinical application has been hampered, however, by a lack of integration between studies that use rigorous experimental interrogation of the endocrine stress response and studies that include sophisticated characterization of patient samples. We aim to address this crucial gap. In this application, we propose to conduct a prospective study to examine the associations among the endocrine stress response, the negative cognitive effects of acute stress, and subsequent cognitive decline in 60 men and 60 women with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI). For our basic study design, we will induce acute stress with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and then measure the endocrine hormone and cognitive responses. The domains of memory and executive functioning will be the primary cognitive outcomes. Salivary samples collected at fixed intervals throughout the TSST will be used to measure stress hormone response; cortisol will be the primary hormone outcome. We will also examine the influence of the APOE gene and polygenic risk scores for AD and collect blood-based biomarkers associated with AD pathophysiology. Specific Aim #1: To determine the association between endocrine response to acute stress and memory and executive test performance following acute stress in individuals with MCI due to AD. Specific Aim #2: To examine the moderating effect of APOE genotype and polygenic risk score on the association between endocrine response to acute stress and cognitive test performance following acute stress in individuals with MCI due to AD. Specific Aim #3: To determine predictors of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration at 2-year follow-up. Secondary Aim: Conduct the analyses from Specific Aims 1-3 in men and women separately in order to identify sex-specific predictors of stress-induced cognitive impairment and cognitive decline and neurodegeneration after 2 years. Public health significance: Given the many recent failures of amyloid-lowering therapies in AD, it is important to identify new potential treatment mechanisms. The proposed study could lay the groundwork for future AD prevention trials targeting stress vulnerability and HPA-axis reactivity in at-risk individuals.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2986,439,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01NS126549-02,Precision Medicine for Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy: Combined Neuroimaging Clinical Approach to Link Phenotypes to Prognosis,"Toward our long-term goal of delivering precision medicine in the treatment of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), we plan to develop a methodological framework to classify HIE based on brain MRI evaluation combined with clinical variables to better predict neurological prognosis. In this proposal, we will create an MRI quantification tool to identify various types of lesions, which, combined with clinical variables, will isolate HIE subtypes and subsequent clinical phenotypes to predict prognosis. HIE is the most common cause of acquired brain injury in the neonatal period. It can result in a wide range of neurological complications that affect various functional domains, with heterogeneous severity. Stratification of HIE subtypes and specific prognoses is essential for developing and delivering targeted adjuvant and rehabilitative treatments and is also necessary for medical providers in order to guide the appropriate allocation of resources. Although predictive biomarkers have been highly anticipated, as of yet, there are none validated. MRI has demonstrated strong predictive power for severe neurobehavioral deficits within the context of severe MRI findings. However, predicting outcomes following moderate-to-mild changes or even a normal-looking brain MRI does not guarantee normal neurobehavioral outcomes. With the recent advances in image analysis technologies, we intend to increase the sensitivity and negative predictive value by detecting and quantifying moderate-to-mild pathological changes, which are difficult to evaluate qualitatively. Since individualized prediction cannot be made from a single feature, as each feature weakly correlates with outcomes, we hypothesize that patient stratification, combining brain MRI features and clinical characteristics, will be highly accurate for individualized prediction. We will apply our automated structure-by-structure image quantification (SIQ) pipeline, developed and validated through R01HD065955, to be applied for the MRI quantification in this proposal. The HIE cohort study (R01HD086058) will provide a library of teaching files that consist of MRIs with various types of lesions, from which the SIQ algorithm learns the features of the lesions. The cohort also includes clinical variables, such as serum markers and electroencephalograms, combined with the MRI features and test data for the validation study. For Aim 1, we will create a reference library that includes MRI atlases with various pathological changes due to HIE. Combined with the multi-atlas label fusion and lesion localization algorithms, the library enables a robust SIQ. For Aim 2, we will apply a supervised learning algorithm to the MRI features quantified by the SIQ to identify brain lesions and the severity that is associated with certain outcomes. Aim 3 will use a supervised classification algorithm for the MRI features and clinical variables to determine the HIE subtypes related to the affected functional domains and the severity of the outcomes. This project will provide a methodological framework with which to identify subgroups of infants with HIE who are at risk of developing neurological complications, and who may benefit from current and future early interventions.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3258,468,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R00EY029011-04,Developing Remyelination Strategies for Demyelinating Optic Neuropathies Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Optic nerve demyelinating diseases such as Optic Neuritis (ON) cause acute reduction of visual acuity and often chronic visual loss. The estimated incidence of ON in the USA is 6.4/100,000, and 50% of the 2.5 million multiple sclerosis (MS) patients worldwide are estimated to develop one or more episodes of ON during the course of their disease. Myelination of the optic nerve is carried out by a specialized cell, the oligodendrocyte (OL), that coats and protects axons and promotes neural conduction. Demyelination can cause apoptosis of the OLs, axonal damage, and neuronal cell death. Remyelination-based treatments have the potential to help protect retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons and reduce chronic vision loss, and perhaps help restore lost vision. The long-term goal of this project is to identify molecular pathways involved in differentiation and maturation of OLs that can be exploited for promoting remyelination of the demyelinated optic nerve. To this end, the PI has developed human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporters for RGCs and OLs, and performed single cell RNA- sequencing and a preliminary high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify regulators of OL differentiation and maturation. Based upon this preliminary data, the PI proposes to: 1) expand the screening effort to identify additional compounds and pathways involved in OL maturation, 2) examine the transcription factors and pathways identified from the preliminary work for their role in OL differentiation, and 3) further identify and systemically characterize microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in OL specification and maturation. To perform the proposed studies, the PI will develop innovative tools such as hPSC-reporters for OL differentiation with inducible CRISPRi (interference) and CRISPRa (activation) system, and a functional in-vitro hOL/hRGC co-culture system for assessing hRGC myelination by hOLs. In the mentored phase, in Dr. Don Zack’s lab, the PI will carry out genome-editing to generate the CRISPRi and CRISPRa lines and acquire training at Wilmer’s HCS facility where small molecule screening to probe for signaling pathways involved in OL maturation will be performed. In the second year, under the guidance of Dr. Jay Baraban (an expert in microRNA biology), the miRNA studies on OLs will be initiated. The mentored phase will also be supplemented by training with Ingo Ruczinski (biostatistics collaborator), who will provide assistance with the pathway analysis and hit validation of HTS. Furthermore, the PI’s co-mentor, Dr. Peter Calabresi, who is a leading scientist in demyelinating diseases, will regularly meet, advise and help him prioritize the genes and pathways for further examination. Additionally, during the mentored phase, the PI will regularly meet with his advisory committee, attend scientific conferences, and continue his career development. The PI is in an ideal environment for the proposed research and for his career development as Dr. Zack has an established hPSC lab, state-of-the-art HCS facilities, and collaborations with renowned neuroscientists and vision-scientists. This will help PI to set-up good collaborations, learn new techniques, and build an independent research laboratory at a well-established academic institution.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,3264,484,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R01MH126676-03,Development and function of hypothalamic Lhx6-positive neurons,"Project Summary GABAergic neurons of the dorsolateral hypothalamus play an essential role in both the regulating the sleep/wake cycle, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control their development. We have recently found that the LIM homeodomain transcription factor Lhx6 is necessary for development of a population of sleep-promoting GABAergic neurons in the zona incerta in the hypothalamus. Lhx6 is essential for development and migration of most telencephalic interneurons, in the hypothalamus Lhx6 is expressed in a much more restricted subset of neurons that do not express markers of telencephalic Lhx6-positive interneurons. The role of Lhx6 in development of telencephalic and hypothalamic neurons differs in several important respects. Lhx6 expression is regulated by different transcription factors in the two regions. Preliminary gene expression analysis has identified a number of genes that are strong candidates for mediating these differences. In this proposal, we aim to identify the molecular mechanisms that guide the specification and survival of hypothalamic Lhx6 neurons. First, we will use a combination of genetic approaches to identify transcriptional regulatory networks that are required for initiation and maintenance of hypothalamic expression of Lhx6, and that control development of distinct subtypes of Lhx6-positive neurons. Next, we will determine whether tangential cell migration plays a critical role in the localization of sleep-promoting Lhx6-positive neurons, and identify the molecular mechanisms that control this process. Finally, we will identify molecular subtypes of sleep-activated Lhx6-positive hypothalamic neurons, and investigate how mutants that disrupt the development of these neurons result in altered regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. This will provide insight into molecular pathways that control the assembly of key components of hypothalamic neural circuitry, and may identify therapeutic targets for treatment of sleep disorders.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2012,282,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R03NS127011-02,Development of TDP-43 nuclear targeting aptamers for ALS/FTD,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are closely-related, fatal neurodegenerative diseases with considerable genetic and pathologic overlap. Postmortem analysis of more than 97% of ALS cases and nearly half of FTD cases demonstrates nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43, a primarily nuclear DNA- and RNA-binding protein that regulates pre-mRNA splicing. Moreover, abundant evidence shows that the loss of TDP-43 nuclear function drives the evolution of many aspects of ALS/FTD pathogenesis. This proposal seeks to build on recent data from our laboratory showing that RNA critically tethers TDP-43 within the nucleus and limits its passive nuclear export. We propose to design a novel RNA-based strategy to oppose TDP-43 nuclear export, guided by two observations: 1) TDP-43 nuclear residence depends on its binding to GU-rich nuclear RNAs, and 2) small GU-rich RNA oligomers transfected into live cells efficiently target and modulate the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of TDP-43. Here, we will develop bivalent RNA oligomers, termed TDP-43 nuclear targeting aptamers (TNTAs), to bind and retain the pool of free TDP-43 that would otherwise diffuse out of the nucleus. The TNTA will consist of a reversible GU-rich TDP-43 targeting sequence (TTS), a linker, and a nucleus-targeting sequence (NTS), to anchor the TNTA-TDP-43 complex within stable nuclear ribonucleoprotein assemblies. Using the (GU)6 sequence as a starting point, studies in aim 1 will further optimize the TTS motif, using the TDP-43 nuclear displacement assay as a readout for successful TTS-TDP-43 interaction. Cells will be transfected by synthetic GU-rich RNAs (or poly-A, as a negative control), and the nuclear exit of endogenous TDP-43 will be monitored by immunofluorescence with automated confocal high-content microscopy. The direct TTS-TDP-43 interaction, its selectivity towards TDP- 43, and reversibility over time will then be evaluated to identify the optimal TTS sequence. In the second aim, the nuclear retention sequences of several classes of endogenous nuclear RNAs will be tested to identify optimal NTS sequences, that, when combined with the TTS can promote TDP-43 nuclear localization. Nuclear tethering of TNTAs via the bacteriophage MS2-loop RNA-MCP system will be utilized as a positive control. TNTAs combining the endogenous validated NTS linked to the GU-rich TTS will then be tested for activity in preventing TDP-43 exit. Finally, the selectivity and reversibility of the TNTAs towards TDP-43 will be determined, and cryptic exon incorporation will be evaluated to ensure no interference with TDP-43 nuclear function. Together, these studies will identify and optimize a new tool to promote TDP-43 nuclear localization, to enable further therapy development and improve our understanding of the regulation of TDP-43 nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,2897,422,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
5R35GM130393-05,Mechanisms of ubiquitin signaling in chromatin-mediated processes,"PROJECT SUMMARY Post-translational modifications of the histone proteins that package DNA play a central role in regulating transcription and repair of DNA damage. The goal of this research program is to determine the molecular mechanism by which attachment of the small protein, ubiquitin, to histone proteins functions in concert with modifications including methylation and acetylation to regulate gene expression and maintain genome integrity. Since misregulation of histone ubiquitination and methylation characterizes many cancers, the results of these studies can be used to design new drugs that target the molecular machines involved in these pathways. A major focus of this research program will be on the mechanism by which monoubiquitination of histone H2B triggers a cascade of events needed to activate gene transcription, including methylation of histone H3 and recruitment of histone chaperones that assist RNA polymerase in transcribing DNA through a chromatin template. A combination of x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and NMR, single molecule biophysics, solution biochemistry and cell-based approaches will be used to study how coactivator complexes such as SAGA bind their chromatin substrates and combine histone deubiquitination, acetylation and recognition of histone methylation to activate transcription. We will also study the mechanism by which H2B ubiquitination triggers histone methylation and determine the distinct mechanism by which different deubiquitinating enzymes mediate nucleosome dynamics. Another aspect of ubiquitin signaling to be addressed in this program is the mechanism by which ubiquitin chains attached to sites of DNA alkylation damage recruit repair enzymes. The molecular insights that will result from the proposed studies will provide a foundation for developing new chemotherapies that target cancers for which there currently are no effective treatments.",2023,,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,1927,271,0.0,False,False,0.0,phase2_nih,,,
